# Implementation Plan

## Status Quo

- CLI handles `.fountain`, `.ly`, and `.csd` inputs; `.storyboard`, `.mid`/`.midi`, `.ump`, and `.session` inputs are unimplemented.
- UMP rendering target is listed but missing from dispatch.
- Environment variables for width/height now apply even when flags are absent.
- Watch mode uses `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource` for file monitoring on supported platforms and falls back to polling on Linux.
- Tests cover help/version output, unknown flags, and SMF header/track parsing. Csound and FluidSynth headers are vendored for consistent builds.
- `MidiFileParser` parses SMF header, track events, channel voice messages (Note On/Off, Control Change, Program Change, Pitch Bend), and meta events (track name, tempo, time signature); remaining message types remain pending.
- `UMPParser` decodes utility, system real-time/common, MIDI 1.0 channel voice, and MIDI 2.0 channel voice messages and validates misaligned or truncated packets; additional UMP message types remain pending.
- Unified MIDI event model introduced; `MidiFileParser` and `UMPParser` emit protocol-based events.

## Action Plan

1. Implement parsers and renderers for `.storyboard`, `.mid`/`.midi`, `.ump`, and `.session` files (SMF header parser implemented).
2. Add `ump` output target in the render dispatcher and ensure all formats are documented.
3. ~~Apply environment variable fallback when width/height flags are absent and add tests for precedence.~~
4. ~~Replace polling watch mode with `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource` on platforms that support it.~~
5. Expand test suite to cover argument parsing, watch/dispatch logic, output correctness, and environment variable precedence.
6. Document integrated audio backends and note that Csound/FluidSynth headers are bundled with the source.
7. Update CLI help text and docs to reflect new inputs, outputs, and features.
8. Maintain this file with up-to-date status and tasks as work progresses.
