                                   Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles

          The MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) specification defines mechanisms and a set
          of Universal System Exclusive messages used for Profile Configuration (and much
          more). However, MIDI-CI does not define the rules for Profile Specifications or
          devices that implement Profiles. This document, the Common Rules for Profiles,
          complements MIDI-CI by defining a set of design rules for all Profile Specifications.

1 Introduction
1.1   Executive Summary
A Profile is a defined set of rules for how a MIDI device implementing the Profile shall respond to a chosen set of
MIDI messages to achieve a particular purpose or to suit a particular application. This specification defines rules
which are commonly applied to all Profiles. The rules also define specific details for using the Profile
Configuration messages which are defined in the MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) specification [MA03].

1.2   Background
MIDI-CI allows devices to communicate their capabilities to each other. Devices can use that capabilities
information to self-configure their MIDI connections and related settings. Profiles are a beneficial component in
enabling intelligent auto-configuration.
A Profile is a defined set of rules for how a MIDI receiver device implementing the Profile shall respond to a
chosen set of MIDI messages to achieve a particular purpose or to suit a particular application. In addition to
defining response to MIDI messages, a Profile may optionally also define other device functionality requirements.
This definition also then implies MIDI implementation of a sender or in some cases may require a defined MIDI
implementation of a sender.
The most successful MIDI feature similar to a Profile in the first 3 decades of MIDI has been General MIDI. GM
allows devices to "know" that a defined set of sounds is available at particular Program Change locations, that the
device receives on all 16 MIDI Channels, that a Drum set is on Channel 10, and that there is defined response to a
chosen set of MIDI messages.
This kind of knowledge shared between devices allows those devices to configure a more integrated level of
control with increased predictability of the results that will come from sending related MIDI messages. MIDI-CI
Profiles are also intended to allow more integrated cooperation between devices.
While GM is the best model of a successful profile concept prior to MIDI-CI, it does not take MIDI-CI or 2-way
communication into account. There is a "GM On" message but no reply from the receiver. MIDI-CI Profiles take
advantage of the 2-way communication so that a sender can know that receiver will use MIDI messages in the
way the Profile specification defines.
This document defines how specific Profile specifications should be written and how devices that are compatible
with MIDI-CI Profile Configuration should use Profiles.
This version of the Common Rules for Profiles defines the use of messages defined in version 1.2 of the M2-101-
UM MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) specification [MA03].

MIDI Port: The source or sink of stream of MIDI data in the MIDI 1.0 data format.
MIDI Transport: A hardware or software MIDI connection used by a Device to transmit and/or receive MIDI
messages to and/or from another Device.
MMA: See MIDI Manufacturers Association.
MUID (MIDI Unique Identifier): A 28-bit random number generated by a Device used to uniquely identify the
Device in MIDI-CI messages sent to or from that Device.
NRPN: Non-Registered Parameter Number, a type of controller message defined in the MIDI 1.0 Protocol
[MA01]. NRPNs have equivalent messages in the MIDI 2.0 Protocol, called Assignable Controllers (see [MA06]).
PE: Property Exchange.
Port: See MIDI Port.
Profile: An MA/AMEI specification that includes a set of MIDI messages and defined responses to those
messages. A Profile is controlled by MIDI-CI Profile Negotiation Transactions. A Profile may have a defined
minimum set of mandatory messages and features, along with some optional or recommended messages and
features. See the MIDI-CI specification [MA03] and the Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles [MA04].
Property: A JSON key-value pair used by Property Exchange, for example "channel": 1.
Property Exchange: A set of MIDI-CI Transactions by which one device may access Property Data from another
device.
Protocol: There are two defined MIDI Protocols: the MIDI 1.0 Protocol and the MIDI 2.0 Protocol, each with a
data structure that defines the semantics for MIDI messages. See [MA01] and [MA06].
Receiver: A MIDI Device which has a MIDI Transport connected to its MIDI In.
Resource: A defined collection of one or more PE Properties with an associated inquiry to access its Properties.
Responder: One of two MIDI-CI Devices with a bidirectional communication between them. The Responder is
the Device that receives an Inquiry message from an Initiator Device as part of a MIDI-CI Transaction and acts
based on negotiation messages managed by the Initiator Device. Also see Initiator.
RPN: Registered Parameter Number, a type of controller message defined in the MIDI 1.0 Protocol [MA01].
RPNs have equivalent messages in the MIDI 2.0 Protocol, called Registered Controllers (see [MA06]).
Sender: A MIDI Device which transmits MIDI messages to a MIDI Transport which is connected to its MIDI Out
or to its MIDI Thru port.
Source: A Source is a Sender which originates or generates MIDI messages. A Source does not include a Sender
which is retransmitting messages which originated in another MIDI Device.
Transaction: An exchange of MIDI messages between two MIDI Devices with a bidirectional connection. All the
MIDI messages in a single Transaction are associated and work together to accomplish one function. The simplest
Transaction generally consists of an inquiry sent by one MIDI Device and an associated reply returned by a
second MIDI Device. A Transaction may also consist of an inquiry from one MIDI Device and several associated
replies from a second MIDI Device. A Transaction may be a more complex set of message exchanges, started by
an initial inquiry from one MIDI Device and multiple, associated replies exchanged between the first MIDI
Device and a second MIDI Device. Also see MIDI-CI Transaction.
UMP: Universal MIDI Packet, see [MA06].
UMP Format: Data format for fields and messages in the Universal MIDI Packet, see [MA06].
UMP MIDI 1.0 Device: any Device that sends or receives MIDI 1.0 Protocol messages using the UMP [MA06].

2.1    Discovering and Configuring Supported Profiles
MIDI-CI inquiries allow an Initiator to ask for a list of Profiles that a Responder supports. The Initiator may use
this information to auto-configure the connection for greater interoperability of specific applications. The Initiator
manages the configuration by enabling and disabling particular Profiles on the Responder. When a Responder
changes its Profiles in response to an event that is not managed by the Initiator, the Responder informs the
Initiator.
For example: a software sound editing application might configure a specific set of on-screen controls to send
associated MIDI messages that control parameters of any device that it discovers which conforms to the Drawbar
Organ Profile. It would configure a different set of on-screen controls and MIDI messages if it found that the
device conforms to an Electric Piano Profile.

                            M2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles v1.1 11-May-2023


To discover Profiles supported by a Responder, the Initiator sends a Profile Inquiry. The Responder replies with
one or more Reply to Profile Inquiry messages to report supported Profiles. These inquiries and replies have
various Address field values to declare Profiles supported at different locations in the device. See Section 2.3. The
final reply from the Responder is the declaration of Profiles available at Address field value 0x7F.

2.2    Profile Identifier (ID)
The MMA and AMEI shall maintain the list of Standard Defined Profiles and assign an official Profile ID to each
Standard Defined Profile.
Standardized Profiles and Manufacturers’ proprietary Profiles are identified in MIDI-CI Profile messages in a set
of 5 bytes:
                                   Table 5 Profile Identifier Data Format

           Byte Number                     Standard Defined Profiles                Manufacturer Specific Profiles
Profile ID Byte 1                      0x7E Standard Defined Profile               Manufacturer SysEx ID 1

Profile ID Byte 2                      Profile Number Bank                         Manufacturer SysEx ID 2

Profile ID Byte 3                      Profile Number                              Manufacturer SysEx ID 3

Profile ID Byte 4                      Profile Version                             Manufacturer-Specific Info 1

Profile ID Byte 5*                     Profile Level*                              Manufacturer-Specific Info 2

        *See [MA03] for more details of Profile ID Byte 5, Profile Level.
Standardized Profiles defined by AMEI and MMA use a Profile ID as defined in the Common Rules for MIDI
Profiles (this specification) and by each Profile Specification. The value of the Profile ID Byte 1 for standardized
Profiles is 0x7E (Universal). Values for Bytes 2 and 3 are assigned by MMA and AMEI. Byte 4 is defined by each
Profile specification. Byte 5 is defined by the “Profile Level and Minimum Requirements” section of this
specification and each Profile specification.
Manufacturers may use MIDI-CI to control Profiles of their own proprietary design by placing their own 3-byte
System Exclusive ID in Profile ID Byte 1, Profile ID Byte 2, and Profile ID Byte 3. For System Exclusive ID
values that are only 1 byte in length, the System Exclusive ID value is placed in the Profile ID Byte 1 and the
remaining 2 ID Bytes are filled with zeroes: ID 00 00. Then every manufacturer defines their own usage of Profile
ID Byte 4 and Profile ID Byte 5.

2.3    Devices, Function Blocks, Groups, Ports, and MIDI Channels
Some MIDI-CI inquiries allow a device to report Profiles that are supported on a single Channel, multiple
Channels, on per Group basis and/or on a per Function Block basis.
MIDI-CI Profile Configuration messages can be addressed on a Channel, Group wide or Function Block wide
basis. Addressing is done using the Device ID of the Universal System Exclusive messages:
      0x7F = Send to/from Function Block
      0x7E = Send to/from the Group (or Port)
      0x00-0x0F = Send to/from Channels 1-16
There are four MIDI Channel structures for Profiles, each of which can be enabled using those MIDI-CI
addresses, as defined in Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.4.
See the MIDI-CI specification v1.2 [MA03] for more about addressing MIDI-CI messages.

                            M2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles v1.1 11-May-2023


2.3.1 Single Channel Profile
Some Profiles define Device functions that use only one MIDI Channel for the Profile. Piano is a typical example.
      A MIDI-CI Initiator asks what Profiles are supported using a target Channel Device ID address 0x00 –
      0x0F. The Responder replies with the same Device ID. Initiator sends Profile Enable message or Profile
      Disable message with the Device ID address of the target MIDI Channel 0x00-0x0F. Responder sends
      Profile Enabled message or Profile Disabled message with the Device ID address of the MIDI Channel
      0x00-0x0F.

2.3.2 Group Profiles: All Channels in a Single Group
All Channel Profiles: Some Profiles define Device functions that use all 16 Channels of a Group or MIDI Port.
General MIDI is a typical example.
      A MIDI-CI Initiator asks what Profiles are supported using the Group Device ID address 0x7E. The
      Responder replies with the Device ID address 0x7E. Initiator sends Profile Enable message or Profile
      Disable message with the Device ID address 0x7E. Responder sends Profile Enabled message or Profile
      Disabled message with the Device ID address 0x7E.

2.3.3 Function Block Profiles: All Channels in a Function Block
All Channel Profiles: Some Profiles define Device functions that use all Channels of a Function Block which
may span more than one Universal MIDI Packet Group.
      A MIDI-CI Initiator asks what Profiles are supported using the Device ID address 0x7F. The Responder
      replies with the Device ID address 0x7F. Initiator sends Profile Enable message or Profile Disable message
      with the Device ID address 0x7F. Responder sends Profile Enabled message or Profile Disabled message
      with the Device ID address 0x7F.

2.3.4 Multi-Channel Profiles: Two or More Channels
Some Profiles define Device functions that use multiple MIDI Channels for the Profile but is not a Group Profile
or a Function Block Profile. Guitar is a typical example that might be defined to use 7 Channels: 6 Member
Channels for the 6 strings plus a Manager Channel for controlling total output volume. Enabling and Disabling the
Profile is also performed on the Manager Channel. See Section 2.3.4.1“Manager Channel and Member Channels”
      A MIDI-CI Initiator asks what Profiles are supported using a target Manager Channel Device ID address
      0x00-0x0F. The Responder replies with the same Device ID. Initiator sends Profile Enable message or
      Profile Disable message with the Device ID address of the target Manager Channel, 0x00-0x0F. Responder
      sends Profile Enabled message or Profile Disabled message with the Device ID address of the Manager
      Channel, 0x00-0x0F.
If a Multi-Channel Profile does not define a fixed number of Channels, then the Profile Details Inquiry
mechanisms should be used to determine the number of Channels that a Responder will use when the Profile is
enabled. See Section 2.5.1.

2.3.4.1 Manager Channel and Member Channels
Profile Specifications which define the use of 2 or more Channels, as described in Section 2.3.4 shall define a
Manager Channel. The Manager Channel shall be the lowest numbered Channel in a series, on the lowest
numbered Group in the series. MIDI-CI Profile Configuration messages are sent on the Manager Channel.
All other active Channels in the Profile are considered Member Channels. The Profile Specification shall define
how Member Channels used by the Profile are identified in relation to the Manager Channel.
In most cases a Manager Channel will be independent from the Member Channels. Typical Manager Channel and
relationship to Member Channels is often as described in this example:



                                       © 2023 MMA and AMEI. All rights reserved.
                                                          14
                            M2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles v1.1 11-May-2023


      A hypothetical five-string Banjo Profile might define that the five Member Channels in sequence starting
      above the Manager Channel are used for messages related to the five strings. Main volume and tone of the
      whole Banjo and other similar messages are typically sent on the Manager Channel. Note related control
      data such as Note On/Off and Pitch Bend for each of the five strings are sent on the Member Channels.
      If the Banjo Profile Responder has declared a Function Block which only has a single Group or has not
      declared a Function Block, then the Manager Channel may be assigned between Channel 1 and Channel 11.
      MIDI-CI Profile Configuration messages are sent on the Manager Channel (1 to 11), and it is known by the
      definition in the Profile Specification that the five strings are on the five Channels sequentially higher than
      that Manager Channel.
In some cases, the Manager Channel may also be a Member Channel, only if Manager functions do not overlap or
conflict with Member Channel functions. One typical use case would be a Profile which defines no Manager
Functions other than MIDI-CI messages for Profile Configuration. The Profile specification shall clearly define
which functions on that Channel are Manager controls and which are Member controls. For example:
      When the Manager Channel is also a Member Channel:
        1. If the Volume message (CC#7) on the Manager Channel affects total output volume of all Member
             Channels, then all the Member Channels shall ignore Volume messages (CC#7) on their own
             Channels.
      Or
        2. the Volume messages (CC#7) on Member Channels controls the volume of that one Channel, then the
             Manager Channel shall use Volume message (CC#7) as the volume of that one Channel and not use it
             for total volume of all Channels.

2.4   Common Profile Configuration Messages (MIDI-CI Messages)
All Profiles Specifications and compatible Devices should support the Common Profile Messages that are defined
in the MIDI Capabilities Inquiry specification.
Also see the MIDI-CI Specification [MA03] for more details of MIDI-CI Profile Configuration messages.

0x20 Profile Inquiry
A device (Initiator) sends this to request a list of Profiles that are supported by a connected device (Responder).
The Initiator may use this information to auto-configure the connection between the devices for increased
interoperability. The message may be addressed to:
    • An individual Channel (addresses 0x00-0x0F) to find the Channel Profiles available on that Channel and
      the Multi-Channel Profiles which can have a Manager Channel on that Channel, or
    • to a Group (address 0x7E) to find the Group Profiles available, or
    • to the Function Block (address 0x7F) to discover all Profiles on the Function Block, including Function
      Block Profiles, Group Profiles, Multi-Channel Profiles, and Single Channel Profiles. (See Section 2.3 for
      more information about addressing)
             Note: While the Profile Inquiry addressed to 0x7F requests all Profiles regardless of MIDI Channel
             structure (See Section 2.3), a Reply to Profile Inquiry message (below) addressed to 0x7F only
             declares Function Block Profile types. Other Profile types are declared in separate replies.

0x21 Reply to Profile Inquiry
When a Responder receives the Profile Inquiry message it shall reply with one or more Reply to Profile
inquiry messages to report a list of Profiles the Responder supports.
The Profiles supported by a Device at the address requested are declared as 2 lists as shown in the following table:
                                    Table 7 Lists of Profiles Supported

          Currently Enabled Profiles Supported            Currently Disabled Profiles Supported

                                                                      the Profile Added Report message.
                                                                 •    Profiles may be removed from this list
                                                                      by the Profile Removed Report
                                                                      message.

            Note:
                 •    Profiles may be changed from Currently Disabled to Currently Enabled by the Set
                      Profile On and Profile Enabled messages.
                 •    Profiles may be changed from Currently Enabled to Currently Disabled by the Set
                      Profile Off and Profile Disabled messages.



When a Responder receives the Profile Inquiry message on a specific Channel address 0x00-0x0F, the Responder
sends this Reply to Profile Inquiry message addressed with that Channel to report the Channel Profiles supported
on the requested Channel (See Section 2.3.1) and the Multi-Channel Profiles which can have a Manager Channel
on that Channel. If the Responder does not support any Profiles on that Channel, then it shall reply with no
Profiles reported.

When a Responder receives the Profile Inquiry message on a specific Group address 0x7E, the Responder sends
this Reply to Profile Inquiry message addressed with that Group to report the Group Profiles supported on the
requested Group (See Section 2.3.2). If the Responder does not support any Group Profiles on that Group, then it
shall reply with no Profiles reported.
When a Responder receives the Profile Inquiry message on the Function Block address 0x7F, it shall reply with
one or more Reply to Profile Inquiry messages in the following order:
        1. If the Responder supports Single Channel Profiles and/or Multi-Channel Profiles which can have a
             Manager Channel on that Channel within the Function Block, then it sends Reply to Profile Inquiry
             messages on those Channels first.
        2. If the Responder supports any Group Profiles within the Function Block, then it sends Reply to Profile
             Inquiry messages with address 0x7E to report Group Profiles supported on each Group of the
             Function Block.
        3. As a final reply, the Responder shall send a Reply to Profile Inquiry message with address 0x7F to
            report Function Block Profiles that are supported by the Device. If the Responder does not support
            any Function Block Profiles or does not support any Profiles at all, it shall send this reply on the
            address 0x7F with no Profiles reported to indicate that no further replies will follow.

0x26 Profile Added Report
While a Device is active, it might change its state such that a Profile is newly added to its capabilities. If the
Device has previously acted as a Responder by sending a Reply to Profile Inquiry message, then the Device
should send a Profile Added Report message to update the list of Currently Disabled Profile Supported declared in
the previous Reply to Profile Inquiry message. See Table 7 Lists of Profiles Supported.
The Profile Added Report message shall be sent with the Destination MUID set to Broadcast (0x7F 7F 7F 7F).
If the newly added Profile is enabled in the Device, then the Device shall then send a Profile Enabled Report
message for that Profile immediately following the Profile Added Report.

0x27 Profile Removed Report
While a Device is active, it might change its state such that it is no longer capable of supporting a Profile. If the
Device has previously acted as a Responder by sending a Reply to Profile Inquiry message, then the Device
should send a Profile Removed Report message to update the list of Currently Disabled Profile Supported declared
in the previous Reply to Profile Inquiry message. See Table 7 Lists of Profiles Supported.
The Profile Removed Report message shall be sent with the Destination MUID set to Broadcast (0x7F 7F 7F 7F).
If the Device is removing a Profile which is currently enabled, then the Device shall send a Profile Disabled
Report message for that Profile before sending the Profile Removed Report message.

0x22 Set Profile On
An Initiator sends this to enable a Profile on a Responder.

0x23 Set Profile Off
An Initiator sends this to disable a Profile on a Responder.

0x24 Profile Enabled Report
A device sends this message if it has enabled a Profile.
This is an acknowledgement upon receipt of a Set Profile On message.
This is an informative message if an event local to the device enables a Profile.
      Example: A change of patch might trigger a change of Profile.

0x25 Profile Disabled Report
A device sends this message if it has disabled a Profile.
This is an acknowledgement upon receipt of a Set Profile Off message.
This is an informative message if an event local to the device disables a Profile.
      Example: A change of patch might trigger a change of Profile.

0x28 Profile Details Inquiry Message
An Initiator sends this to discover details of the Profile implementation of a Responder. An Initiator may make
this inquiry to retrieve useful information from the Responder before instructing the Responder to enable a Profile.
This message may also be used to discover details about a Responder's Profile implementation while it is enabled.
For example, an Initiator might discover:
        1. How many Channels may be used or assigned by the Responder for a Multi-Channel Profile.
        2. Which optional Profile features the Responder is capable of supporting.
The details which are being requested are determined by the Inquiry Target field. See Section 2.5.
The details which may be discovered are defined by the specification for the requested Profile Id.
If a Responder which supports Profile Configuration receives a Profile Details Inquiry message addressed to a
Profile Identifier which is not supported by the Responder, the Responder should reply by sending a MIDI-CI
NAK message with a Status Code value 0x04.

0x29 Reply to Profile Details Inquiry Message
When a Responder receives the Profile Details Inquiry message it shall send this message with data appropriate to
the Inquiry Target in the Profile Details Inquiry message.
If a Target Data definition allows it, the Reply to Profile Details message for that Target Data may also be sent
without prior receipt of a Profile Details Inquiry message. It is then used as a Notification message from a device
for the Target Data (See Section 2.5).

2.5    Profile Details Inquiry: Inquiry Target
The Profile Details Inquiry mechanism allows an Initiator to get information from the Responder about its Profile-
related implementation. There are two types of information which may be requested (the target):
        1. Registered Target Data: the format of the reply is defined by MIDI Association and AMEI in this
            Common Rules for Profiles specification and designed for use by many Profiles.
        2. Profile Specific Target Data: the format of the reply is defined by the Profile specification and is
            unique to that Profile.
Registered Target Data definitions in this Common Rules for Profiles specification shall define whether a Reply to
Profile Details Inquiry Message may also be used as a Notification for that Target Data.
A Profile specification shall define whether a Reply to Profile Details Inquiry Message may be also used as a
Notification for that Target Data.
Following are the definitions of Registered Target Data. In this revision of the Common Rules for Profiles there is
one Inquiry Target defined. Other Registered Target Data may be defined in future revisions of this specification.

2.5.1 Profile Details Inquiry Target Data: Number of MIDI Channels
Inquiry Target field = 0x00

                            M2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles v1.1 11-May-2023


This Registered Target Data allows an Initiator and Responder to negotiate the number of Channels which will be
allocated when enabling a multichannel Profile which may have a variable number of channels as described in
Section 2.3.4 Multi-Channel Profiles: 2-256 Channels.
A Reply to Profile Details Inquiry Message with this Target Data shall not be sent as a Notification.
When the Responder receives a Profile Details Inquiry message with the Inquiry Target field set to 0x00, the
inquiry is Number of MIDI Channels. The reply data has 2 defined fields which contain the data requested:
         Table 8 Reply to Profile Details Inquiry Message, Maximum Number of Channels

   0xF7      End Universal System Exclusive

After the Initiator receives the Reply to Profile Details Inquiry Message with Maximum Number of MIDI
Channels and when the Initiator sends an Enable Profile message. The Initiator shall not set the Number Channels
Requested field in the Enable Profile message to a number higher than the Responder declared in the Maximum
Number of Channels field.
The complete steps to negotiate the Number of MIDI Channels used by a Profile are as follows:

   0xF7      End Universal System Exclusive


Step 5: Profile Enabled
Initiator knows that the Profile is enabled and how many Channels have been allocated.

2.6    Enabling Profiles
A device shall enable any Profile it supports after it receives the associated Set Profile On Message. After the
device has enabled the Profile, it shall reply with a Profile Enabled message.
If any action local to a device enables a particular Profile, the device shall send the associated Profile Enabled
message.

                              M2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles v1.1 11-May-2023


If a device receives a Program Change message that causes a specific Profile to be enabled, the device shall send
the associated Profile Enabled message.
Reply When Responder Cannot Enable or Does Not Support a Profile:
      • If a device receives a Set Profile On message for a Profile that it supports but the device is unable to enable
        that Profile, then the device shall reply with a Profile Disabled Report.
      • If a device receives a Set Profile On message for a Profile that it does not support, then it should reply with
        a MIDI-CI NAK Message.

2.7     Disabling Profiles
A device should disable a Profile after it receives the associated Set Profile Off Message from an Initiator. After
the device has disabled the Profile, it shall reply with a Profile Disabled message. However, if a device is not able
to disable a particular Profile, then it shall reply with a Profile Enabled message.
If any action local to a device disables an enabled Profile, the device shall send the associated Profile Disabled
message.
If a device receives a Program Change message that causes a specific Profile to be disabled, the device shall send
the associated Profile Disabled message.
Reply When Device Cannot Disable or Does Not Support a Profile:
      • If a device receives a Set Profile Off message for a Profile that it supports but the device is unable to disable
        that Profile, then the device shall reply with a Profile Enabled Report.
      • If a device receives a Set Profile Off message for a Profile that it does not support, then it should reply with
        a MIDI-CI NAK Message.

2.8     Mutually Exclusive Profiles
Some combination of Profiles can be enabled simultaneously on one MIDI Channel. But in some cases, a device
might not be able to support particular combinations of simultaneous Profiles. A device may report that it cannot
support the simultaneous combination of 2 requested Profiles.
      • Example 1: For many devices it would be reasonably possible to allow Electric Piano Profile and Guitar
        Effects Profile to exist simultaneously on the same MIDI Channel, perhaps for a sound of an Electric Piano
        going through Phaser + Overdrive.
      • Example 2: For many devices it would not be feasible to allow Electric Piano Profile and Drawbar Organ
        Profile to exist simultaneously on the same MIDI Channel. Many devices may not be able to do both at the
        same time. On the other hand, some devices may allow this combination, perhaps if the Notes played on
        that Channel trigger a layered sound of Electric Piano + Drawbar Organ.
If a device has a Profile (Profile A) enabled and it receives a Profile On message for another Profile (Profile B)
that cannot be simultaneously supported with Profile A, the device should switch to the new Profile and send 2
replies to the Profile On message:
          1. Profile Disabled Report for Profile A
          2. Profile Enabled Report for Profile B

2.9     Avoiding Excessive Profile Configuration Reports
Some Devices allow a user to quickly scroll through a list of many Programs. If such a Device changes Profiles
based on the choice of Programs, the Device should avoid sending Profile Configuration messages for every
program in the list which is scrolled.
Such a Device should reasonably limit Profile Configuration messages to those which match a user’s intended
selection. One potential implementation is to wait some short time after a program has been selected before
sending Profile Enabled Report, Profile Disabled Report, Profile Added Report, and Profile Removed Report.

3 Rules for Profile Definitions
Each Standard Defined Profile is defined in a separate Defined Profile specification document for that Profile.
Each Profile specification defines the factors that allow a high level of interoperability between devices that share
support for that Profile.

3.1     Profile Specifications
A Profile Specification defines the Receiver device implementation of specific MIDI messages including but not
limited to:
      • Response to Note On/Off messages
      • Profile Specific Note On/Off Attributes
      • Response to messages that influence note tuning
      • Response to Control Change messages
      • Response to specific Registered Controller (RPN) messages
      • Response to Bank Select and Program Change messages
      • Response to System messages
      • Any applicable Universal System Exclusive messages
      • Any Profile-specific System Exclusive messages
A Profile Specification may also define other Receiver implementation requirements including but not limited to:
      • Device functional entities and topology
      • Minimum Polyphony required
      • Number of MIDI Channels supported (See Sections 2.3 and 2.5.1)
      • Message response times or other performance standards
      • Other Non-MIDI data types supported (example: audio samples)
      • Specific sounds or programs

3.1.1 Control Change, Registered Controllers (RPN), and Assignable Controllers
      (NRPN)
Control Change messages should not gain new definitions within a Profile but should be reserved for legacy
applications.
As a general rule (but not a hard requirement) new Profiles should define Registered Controller (RPN) messages
to control parameters that have not previously been defined.
Manufacturer-Specific Profiles should use Assignable Controllers (NRPN) messages to control any function that
does not have a Control Change or Registered Controller (RPN) defined for that function.

3.2     Profile Support Level and Minimum Requirements
A Profile may define several levels of compatibility or compliance.
Profile specifications shall clearly define the set of properties or features that are the minimum requirements for a
device to claim that it supports that Profile.
Profile specifications may also define extended properties or features that are optional, available for common use
but not absolutely required for a device to claim that it conforms to that Profile.
Profile Specifications define which properties or features belong to defined levels of support that are indicated by
“Profile ID Byte 5, Profile Level” in the 6 Common Profile Messages of MIDI-CI. See the following table.



                                   Table 13 Levels of Profile Supported

                    Profile ID Byte 5 Profile Level           Profile Support Level
                                    0x00                      Partial

                                    0x01                      Minimum Required

                                   0x02-7E                    Minimum Required plus optional,
                                                              Extended Feature Sets as defined
                                                              by the Profile specification.

                                    0x7F                      Highest Possible


Partial
Reported by a Receiver that it generally supports the Profile but lacks some part(s) of the defined Minimum
Required. The manufacturer believes the device offers valuable features of the Profile or that primary application
of the Profile functionality is delivered even if Profile compliance is not 100%.
If a Receiver reports that it has Partial Support Level, then after Enabling the Profile, the Sender should send
messages to the Receiver as though the Receiver meets the Minimum Required. Sender or Receiver may choose to
display a notice to the user that complete Profile function might not be achieved.

Minimum
Reported by a Receiver that fully implements all the Profile features that are defined as the Minimum Required.

Extended Feature Sets
Profile specification may define specific extended feature sets in other Profile Levels of support. The Profile
Support Level of each extended feature of the Profile should be clearly defined. Profile designers should give
careful consideration whether implementation with some extended features should be defined as an Extended
Feature Set or whether there is sufficient functionality to warrant a separate Profile specification. If there are
credible use cases for the Extended Features without using the Base Level features, then a separate Profile
specification is probably warranted.

Highest Possible
A Sender uses the value 0x7F for the Profile Level Support field when sending a Set Profile On message. When a
Receiver receives a Set Profile On message with Highest Possible Level value set, the Receiver should enable all
features of the Profile that it supports.

3.2.1 Device Instrument Definitions and Channel Structures
A Profile shall define the use of only one of the following MIDI Channel structures:
    •     Single Channel Profile as defined in Section 2.3.1
    •     Group Profile as defined in Section 2.3.2
    •     Function Block Profile as defined in Section 2.3.3
    •     Multi-Channel Profile as defined in Section 2.3.4
However, some device types may be defined for more than one of those structures above.
        Hypothetical Example 1: A classic Drawbar Organ is a 3-manual instrument that would usually use 4 MIDI
        Channels (Manager, Upper, Lower, Pedals). But there are many single manual Drawbar organs and many
        multi-Channel synthesizers which can assign a Drawbar Organ to just 1 Channel.
        Hypothetical Example 2: The original General MIDI specification was defined for 16 Channel applications,
        but MIDI-CI allows a GM profile to be enabled on a single Channel.

                            M2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles v1.1 11-May-2023


Multiple Profiles, with separate Profile Identifier values, are used to differentiate between the different MIDI
Channel structures.
      Hypothetical Example 1: A Single Manual Drawbar Organ vs. a 3-Manual Drawbar Organ, each having its
      own Profile ID Number:
             Three Manual Drawbar Organ Profile (3-Channels with Manager Channel on Swell/Upper Manual)
             Single Manual Drawbar Organ Profile
      Hypothetical Example 2: There could be 3 separate but related Profiles for General MIDI Level 2, each
      with a unique Profile ID Number:
             General MIDI Level 2 Profile (16 Channels)
             General MIDI Level 2 Single Channel Melodic Profile
             General MIDI Level 2 Single Channel Drums Profile
In such cases, a single Profile specification document may define more than one Profile Id because there is high
commonality of the messages used by the Profiles.

3.3    Profile Details Inquiry
If a Profile is a Multi-Channel Profile as defined in Section 2.3.4 and does not define a fixed number of Channels,
then the Profile specification shall define that the use of the Profile Details Inquiry mechanism should be used to
negotiate the number of Channels to be allocated (see Section 2.5.1).
A Profile specification may define the use of the Profile Details Inquiry with Registered Targets applicable to the
Profile
A Profile specification may define optional, extended features that a Receiver may support. Then the Profile shall
clearly define the Profile Specific Target(s) used and the format of the targeted data in a reply.

3.4    Property Exchange
A Profile specification may define Property Exchange Resources which are useful to realize the goals of the
Profile. Those Resources may be common Resources which have already been defined for general use. Or the
Profile may define new Resources which are uniquely defined to serve the purposes of the Profile.

3.5    Commonality of Profile Properties/Parameters
As much as practicably possible, Profile definitions should use the same message to control any function that is
already defined elsewhere.
      For Example: GM2 already defines Reverb Level on CC#91. In most cases it is beneficial for another
      Profile that contains controls for reverb to use that same controller for its reverb level.
However, this is just a guideline for commonality across Profiles. It may not be reasonable or feasible to observe
this guideline in all parameters of all Profile definitions.

3.6    Note On/Off with Attribute Type
A Profile may define the use of specific Attribute Types and the associated Attribute Data fields in Note On and
Note Off messages.
When a Profile defines the use of Attribute Type 0x02 (Profile Specific), then the format of the Attribute Data
fields for those Note On and Note Off messages shall be defined by the Profile specification. This definition of the
Attribute Data is only known by devices which understand the Profile. Devices that do not understand the
currently active Profile should ignore the Attribute Data when the Attribute Type is set to 0x02. See the M2-104-
UM Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format and MIDI 2.0 Protocol specification [MA06], for more details of the
Attribute Types and the associated Attribute Data fields.

3.6.1 Control Change (CC) Messages
MIDI 1.0 has defined default assignment of Control Change messages to specific parameters. Profiles shall
observe those legacy assignments. A list of Control Change messages that Profiles should use if they have the
associated parameter is attached as Appendix A. At the time of enabling a Profile, the device shall reset these
Control Change destination assignments. A Profile might also define that certain parameters should or shall be
reset to their default values. For a list of standardize default values see M2-113-UM MIDI-CI Profile: Default
Control Change Mapping specification [MA07].
Refer to the latest MIDI specifications for any further updates to the list of Control Change Messages.

3.6.2 Registered Controllers (RPN)
For new control parameters that are not already assigned by MIDI 1.0 to specific Control Change messages,
Profiles should assign the parameter to a Registered Controller (RPN). Profiles may also assign a Registered
Controller for parameters normally addressable by a Control Change where increased functionality of the message
is required (for example, for increased resolution or for relative control).
Assigning a function to a Registered Controller requires approval of the MMA and AMEI.

3.6.3 Manufacturer Specific Profiles and Assignable Controllers
Manufacturer Specific Profiles that define unique parameters that are not addressed by defined Control Change or
Registered Controller (RPN) messages may be controlled by Assignable Controllers (NRPN) messages without
specific approval.

3.7     Mode Messages
MIDI Mode Messages (CC#120-127) have special functionality. All Profiles shall define the response to Reset All
Controllers (CC#121). A Profile for any device that uses Note-On/Off messages shall define the response to all of
these, even if the response is the default MIDI 1.0 meaning. Some might be defined as ignored. Some Mode
change messages might trigger All Notes Off while ignoring the rest of the default mechanisms (See General
MIDI Level 2 as an example).
        All Sound Off (CC#120)
        Reset All Controllers (CC#121)
        Local On/Off (CC#122)
        All Notes Off (CC#123)
        Omni Mode Off (CC#124)
        Omni Mode On (CC#125)
        Mono Mode On (CC#126)
        Poly Mode On (CC#127)

3.8     Profile Categories
There are several common categories of Profiles. The category of a Profile is used to help organize or group
similar Profiles into related sets. In particular, this is used to assign Registered Controllers (RPN) numbers to
parameters defined by each Profile.
Profiles are organized into 3 categories:
      • Feature Profiles or Ancillary Profiles (General MIDI, Show Control, MIDI Visual Control, Note Tuning,
        MPE, Sample Dump, Mixed Data Types)
      • Instrument Profiles (Orchestral Strings, Piano, Organ, Drums)
      • Effect Profiles (Reverb, Delay, Chorus, Overdrive, Rotary, etc.)

3.8.1 Feature Profiles
Some Feature Profiles define features and MIDI implementation requirements that apply across a wide range of
musical instrument types. Examples might include Tuning Tables, Real Time Direct Pitch Control, Per Note
Expression (like MPE), Layer/Zone Key Configuration, etc.
Some Feature Profiles define features and MIDI implementation requirements that apply to devices that record,
edit, or modify MIDI data such as Arpeggiators, Sequencers or Rhythm/Music Style engines.
Some Feature Profiles define features and MIDI implementation requirements for devices that are not a musical
instrument or an audio effects processor. Examples might include Lighting Control, Drone Flight Control, Video
Effects Control, Mixer Control and Automation, DAW Software Control, etc.

3.8.2 Instrument Profiles
Instrument Profiles define features and MIDI implementation requirements for various musical instrument types
or devices that use Note On/Off messages to represent musical notes. Typical Instrument Profiles might include
Piano, Organ, Orchestral Strings, Guitar, Brass Instruments, Drums, Subtractive Synthesizer, FM Synthesizer, etc.

3.8.3 Effect Profiles
Effect Profiles define features and MIDI implementation requirements for various audio processor types. Typical
Effect Profiles might include Reverb, Chorus, Compressor, Overdrive, Rotary, Delay, Audio Mixer, etc.

3.9   Protocol Differences
Profiles can be supported by devices using the MIDI 1.0 Protocol and/or the MIDI 2.0 Protocol. Some Profiles
might be written for only one protocol. Profile specifications shall state which MIDI protocols are supported.
In the case of Profiles supporting multiple protocols, it is not mandated that performance must be equal for all
protocols. MIDI 2.0 has some messages and features that do not have equivalent messages and features in MIDI
1.0. If Profile performance is not equal on all supported MIDI protocols, the Profile specification should clearly
delineate the differences.
In some cases, a Profile might define a different mechanism in each protocol and define a unique translation of
those mechanisms between different protocols when the mechanisms are not accomplished by equivalent
messages. Standard Translator devices may not be able to perform that unique translation. But specialized
translators might be available to support the unique features of such Profiles.
Notwithstanding the differences explained above, Profiles shall support the default assignment of Control Change
messages as defined in Section 3.4.1. whether using MIDI 1.0 Protocol or MIDI 2.0 Protocol.
