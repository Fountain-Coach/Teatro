                            Common Rules for MIDI-CI Property Exchange

          The MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) specification defines mechanisms and a set
          of Universal System Exclusive messages used for Property Exchange. However, it
          does not define all the rules for Properties or devices that implement Property
          Exchange. This document, the Common Rules for MIDI-CI Property Exchange,
          complements MIDI-CI by defining a set of design rules for all Property Exchange
          Resources and Properties.

1.2     Terminology

1.2.1 Definitions
AMEI: Association of Musical Electronics Industry. Authority for MIDI Specifications in Japan.
Category: A collection of MIDI-CI messages grouped together because they function together or address similar
types of mechanisms.
Chunk: A single System Exclusive message that is one segment of a complete Property Exchange message which
spans multiple System Exclusive messages.
Controller Message: Any MIDI Message from the following list:
  MIDI 1.0 and MIDI 2.0 Protocol:
      • Control Change
      • Channel Pressure (Aftertouch)
      • Poly Pressure (Key Aftertouch)
      • Registered Controller (RPN)
      • Assignable Controller (NRPN)
      • Pitch Bend
  MIDI 2.0 Protocol only:
      • Per-note Registered Controller (including Relative versions)
      • Per Note Assignable Controller (including Relative versions)
      • Per Note Pitch Bend
Data Set: A complete Property Exchange message whether sent in one System Exclusive message in single
Chunk or in multiple Chunks.
Destination: A Receiver to which the Sender intends to send MIDI messages.
Device: An entity, whether hardware or software, which can send and/or receive MIDI messages.
Device ID: A one-byte field in Universal System Exclusive messages, as defined in the MIDI 1.0 Specification
[MA01], to indicate which device in the system is supposed to respond. The more specific application of Device
ID in MIDI-CI messages is defined in the MIDI Capability Inquiry [MA03] specification. The use of “Device” in
this context is not the same as a Device as defined above.
Foundational Resource: A Resource which provides core Properties of a Device which are critical or highly
valuable to properly implement numerous other Resources.
Function Block: A single logical entity which describes the functional components available on a UMP Endpoint
of a Device, A Function Block operates on a set of one or more Groups.
Group: A field in the UMP Format addressing some UMP Format MIDI messages (and some UMPs comprising
any given MIDI message) to one of 16 Groups. See the M2-104-UM Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format and
MIDI 2.0 Protocol specification [MA06].
Initiator: One of two MIDI-CI Devices with a bidirectional communication between them. Initiator has the
management role of setting and negotiating parameters for interoperability between the two Devices. The primary
goal of Initiator is usually (but not strictly required to be) configuring two Devices for subsequent communication
from Initiator as MIDI transmitter to Responder as MIDI receiver. The role of Initiator and Responder may
alternate between the two MIDI-CI Devices. Either MIDI-CI Device may initiate a MIDI Transaction (act as
Initiator) at any time. Also see Responder.
Inquiry: A message sent by an Initiator to begin a Transaction.
JSON: JavaScript Object Notation as defined in [ECMA01].
List Resource: A specific type of Resource that provides a list of objects in a JSON array.

MIDI-CI Property Exchange specification [MA05].
MIDI 1.0 Protocol: Version 1.0 of the MIDI Protocol as originally specified in [MA01] and extended by MA and
AMEI with numerous additional MIDI message definitions and Recommended Practices. The native format for
the MIDI 1.0 Protocol is a byte stream, but it has been adapted for many different transports. MIDI 1.0 messages
can be carried in UMP packets. The UMP format for the MIDI 1.0 Protocol is defined in the M2-104-UM
Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format and MIDI 2.0 Protocol specification [MA06].

Tempo: The rate at which a passage of music is or should be played, declared as and measured in number of
Clocks per a unit of Time (typically beats per minute).
Time: An expression of time as measured in hours, minutes, and seconds (and further subdivisions).
Transaction: An exchange of MIDI messages between two MIDI Devices with a bidirectional connection. All the
MIDI messages in a single Transaction are associated and work together to accomplish one function. The simplest
Transaction generally consists of an inquiry sent by one MIDI Device and an associated reply returned by a
second MIDI Device. A Transaction may also consist of an inquiry from one MIDI Device and several associated
replies from a second MIDI Device. A Transaction may be a more complex set of message exchanges, started by
an initial inquiry from one MIDI Device and multiple, associated replies exchanged between the first MIDI
Device and a second MIDI Device.

2 Introduction


2.1   Executive Summary
Property Exchange is used to Discover, Get, and Set many properties including but not limited to device
configuration settings, a list of controllers and destinations, a list of programs with names and other metadata,
manufacturer, model number, and version. This specification defines rules which are commonly applied to all
Property Exchange Transactions. The rules also define specific details for using the Property Exchange messages
which are defined in the MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) specification [MA03].
Property Exchange can enable devices to auto map controllers, edit programs, change state and also provide visual
editors to DAW’s without any prior knowledge of the device and without specifically crafted software. This
means that devices could work on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, embedded operating systems, and web
browsers and may provide tighter interactions with DAWs and hardware controllers.
Property Exchange provides generalized access to device properties that might otherwise only be accessible
through custom applications. Custom applications may continue to provide a more unique experience. However,
the generalized mechanisms of Property Exchange allow functionality between devices and applications that are
not custom designed. Devices that use Property Exchange are more likely to continue to function through
underlying system upgrades, with future devices unknown today, or on new platforms that appear in the
marketplace.

2.2   Background
The MIDI-Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) specification (part of MIDI 2.0) defines an architecture that allows
devices with bidirectional communication to agree to use MIDI 2.0 capabilities. These new capabilities extend
MIDI 1.0 while carefully protecting backward compatibility. MIDI-CI features “fall back” mechanisms so that if a
device does not support new features, MIDI continues to work as defined by MIDI 1.0.
Property Exchange is a set of MIDI-CI messages used to access a wide range of properties in MIDI devices. The
exchange of properties takes place between a MIDI-CI Initiator and a MIDI-CI Responder.
This Common Rules for Property Exchange document provides a complement to the MIDI-CI specification by
defining details of the Property Exchange mechanism and rules for the data payload in MIDI-CI Property
Exchange messages. Further Property Exchange specifications define schemas and various data payloads that use
the rules in MIDI-CI and this document to achieve specific tasks.

3 Property Exchange Overview
3.1   Property Exchange Core Concepts and Mechanisms
Inquiry and Reply
Property Exchange is a dialogue between two MIDI Devices using Inquiry messages and matching Reply
messages. These two Devices are the MIDI-CI Initiator and the MIDI-CI Responder.

Start Up
1. Before two Devices can use Property Exchange, the Initiator enacts a Discovery Transaction with the
    Responder. See the MIDI-CI specification [MA03] for use of the Discovery Transaction.
2. The two Devices use an Inquiry: Property Exchange Capabilities message and reply to discover basic Property
    Exchange support capabilities of each of the two Devices.
3. An Initiator sends an Inquiry: Get Property Data message with a “ResourceList” request to discover which
    Property Exchange features a Responder supports.

Get and Set
The core functions of Property Exchange are Getting and Setting a wide range of properties or values of properties
of an attached device using an Inquiry: Get Property Data message and an Inquiry: Set Property Data message.
These inquiries are messages issued by the Initiator, with reply messages being returned by the Responder.

Subscriptions
The Initiator may subscribe to a Resource from the Responder (if the Responder reports that the specific Resource
is subscribable). When the subscribed Resource is changed on the Responder, the Responder informs the Initiator
by a Subscription message. The subscription mechanism can also be used to keep the understanding of a Resource
synchronized between Initiator and Responder.

Resources
Inquiries use Resources that are defined by either the MMA/AMEI or the device manufacturer to describe the
Properties that can be retrieved and updated by Property Exchange. Resource definitions include the intent,
intelligence required to use them, and how they relate with other Resources. Device manufacturers may decide
which Resources to implement. However, response to ResourceList (see Section 14) is mandatory for all devices
that support Property Exchange.

Property Data
When devices Get, Set or Subscribe to a Resource, the Property Data for the Resource is the targeted data. The
Resource defines the content of the Property Data.

Error Messages
Property Exchange defines a set of informative error messages that are returned in an associated Reply message if
an error occurred.
Property Exchange also defines a Notify message to report general errors when it is not possible to send a more
informative error message via a Reply message.
MIDI-CI also provides a NAK message that can be used with Property Exchange.

Data Formats – System Exclusive, JSON, and Other Data
Property Exchange is sent via MIDI-CI Universal System Exclusive messages. System Exclusive SubID#2 of the

Data field and a Property Data Field. Header Data is JSON compliant, with defined restrictions. The Property Data
may be by default JSON data with defined restrictions, or any other data format depending on the definition of the
Resource being used.

Use MIDI Messages Whenever Possible
  Property Exchange has a "MIDI messages first" approach. If a method of changing a setting can be
  accomplished by using a common MIDI message (such as a Program Change or Control Change message)
  then the MIDI message method shall be used.

3.2    Steps to Use Property Exchange
   1. Perform a MIDI-CI Discovery Transaction (See MIDI-CI [MA03] for details), exchanging information to:
      A. Get the MUID of both devices
      B. Ensure both devices support Property Exchange
      C. Get Manufacturer SysEx ID of both devices
      D. Get Device Family of both devices
      E. Get Device Family Model Number of both devices
      F. Get Software Revision Level of both devices
2. Perform an Inquiry: Property Exchange Capabilities Transaction to get fundamental details of Property
    Exchange Support
3. Perform an Inquiry: Get Property Data Transaction with a ResourceList Resource to discover support for the
    desired Property Data.
4. Recommended but optional: Perform an Inquiry: Get Property Data Transaction with a DeviceInfo Resource to
    get Property Data with fundamental information about the Responder.
5. Recommended but optional: Perform an Inquiry: Get Property Data Transaction with a ChannelList Resource
    to get Property Data with fundamental information about the Responder.
6. Perform a Get, Set, or Subscribe Transaction with the desired Resource to use the associated Property Data.
Repeat Step 6 whenever necessary to use other desired Resources (Steps 1 to 5 are only needed once if the
Initiator can store the information discovered in those Steps).



3.3    Property Exchange Message Format
Property Exchange messages are in the following format:

3.4    Content of Examples in This Specification
Examples throughout the remainder of this specification do not include all the fields of the message as shown
above in Section 3.4. Most examples only show the contents of the Header Data Field and/or the contents of the
Property Data Field.
Examples are designed to show implementation concepts and do not always use specification-defined content.
Resources and Property Data shown may be fictitious or hypothetical examples.
Section 14 "Resource: ResourceList" does include a definition of a Resource and the associated Property Data.
However, examples in this section may also include fictitious or hypothetical content to explain implementation
concepts.
Refer to other AMEI/MMA specifications for defined Resources and Property Data.

4 Example Minimal Implementation
This section shows an example of implementing MIDI-CI Property Exchange in a very simple device. In this case
the device is an effect pedal that can be controlled by MIDI. Software on the computer acts as the MIDI-CI
Initiator and the effect pedal is the Responder.
  Note: This is a hypothetical example to give a simplified overview of an implementation. The data as presented
  in this example should not be considered to be definitive for any Device.




            Figure 1 Computer Connected to a Pedal Supporting Property Exchange


The effect pedal supports inquiries for 3 Resources:
• ResourceList
• DeviceInfo
• AllCtrlList
The effect pedal has a simple parser to recognize only these 3 inquiries. When it recognizes an inquiry, it replies
with a preformed SysEx message fixed in ROM. The SysEx messages include the Property Data as described in
the following tables:
    Note: Tables in this example focus on the payload and omit other fields in the messages. See Section 3.4.

Action 1:
Perform a MIDI-CI Discovery Transaction, exchanging fundamental information between the software and the
effect pedal (See MIDI-CI [MA03] for details).

Action 2:
The software sends an Inquiry: Property Exchange Capabilities message to request details of Property Exchange
Support from the effect pedal. The effect pedal returns a Reply to Property Exchange Capabilities message.

      Note: See MIDI-CI specification for a complete list of all MIDI-CI messages

5.2     Property Data Set in Multiple Chunks
A Device may choose to send the Data Set of a Property Exchange as a single SysEx message or as a set of
multiple SysEx messages known as “Chunks”.
Any message that contains Header Data only and does not contain any Property Data may not use the Chunking
mechanism. Headers shall only be in the first chunk.
When a complete Property Exchange SysEx message, with its payload Resource Data, exceeds the size of the
“Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size” of the other Device (discovered in the initial Discovery Transaction
between the devices) the sender shall break the message into multiple Chunks. A Device may also choose to send
a message in multiple Chunks for its own design requirements.
If the Device chooses to send a Data Set in multiple Chunks, it specifies the “Number of Chunks in Data Set” and
labels each Chunk with a sequential “Number of This Chunk”.
An additional Flow Control mechanism is defined in Section 15 to help reduce loss of chunks in Resources that
have larger payloads.
See the MIDI-CI specification [MA03] for more details including values for special cases.

5.3     Request ID
The Request ID is a number from 0 to 127 and has 3 functions:
1. The Request ID is used to associate multiple Chunks of a single PE message. Every Chunk of a message shall
    contain the same Request ID.
2. The Request ID is used to associate a reply to the inquiry that prompted a response. The reply to an inquiry
    message shall contain the Request ID that was sent in the inquiry.
3. The Request ID also allows the Device to support multiple messages being sent and received at one time. This
    can be useful to prevent a larger PE message which is split over many chunks from blocking smaller requests.
    For example, it may take some time for a Responder to gather and transfer a complete Data Set in response to
    an inquiry. In this case, an Initiator might want to make a 2nd inquiry before the response to the 1st inquiry
    has been completed.
Using the Inquiry Property Exchange Capabilities mechanism, each Device reports the
Number of Simultaneous Property Exchange Requests Supported. An Initiator or Responder shall not use more
than the reported number of requests supported by the other device.
Some devices may have a Number of Simultaneous Property Exchange Requests Supported which declares a total
limit shared among all connected Initiators. An Initiator needs to deal with the possibility that the number of
Number of Simultaneous Property Exchange Requests Supported may be exhausted due to other requests from
other Initiators. A Responder may reply with a "Too many requests" error (see Section 7.4.1) and the request will
need to be retried.
If an Initiator has exhausted the Number of Simultaneous Property Exchange Requests Supported, it should not
issue any new request until a previous Transaction has completed.
Request IDs may be reused after a Transaction is complete.
Request ID values are unique only to the connection between a specific Initiator and specific Responder,
determined by the MUID of those 2 devices. The same Request ID value may be active on a connection between a
different pair of MUIDs without incurring a collision.
Requests that don't receive a response will time out and the Request ID can be reused. See Section 12.2 for more
details about timeouts.

6 Property Data Formats
Property Exchange SysEx messages have separate Header Data and Property Data fields.
By default, Property Data shall be JSON data.
However, if a Header Data field includes a "mediaType" Property, the associated Property Data may be non-JSON
(see Section 6.2).
By default, the Property Data field is uncompressed. See Section 6.2.2 for details of optional compression and or
encoding of the Property Data field.

6.1    General Rules for JSON Data in the Property Data Field
• Property names shall use camelCase ASCII strings (“a-z”, “A-Z”, “0-9” only).
• Property Names shall not be just numbers e.g. "0" or "120".
• Property Names should be kept short while still being meaningful.
• Property Names are case sensitive.
• All Numbers are in Decimal (Base 10). The JSON standard does not support hexadecimal number values such
  as 0x7F, as commonly used in MIDI documentation. These shall be converted to numbers (integers). e.g. Hex
  number 0x42 (or 42H) shall be converted to 66.

6.1.1 7-Bit Encoding of JSON String Values
Due to the restrictions of MIDI 1.0 SysEx, JSON string values have the following rules:
      7-bit ASCII characters are supported, except that the "\" character has a special function as defined in the
          JSON standard, ECMA404 [ECMA01].
          For clarity in Property Exchange, as ECMA404 may be unclear about this, the forward slash character
              "/" can be optionally escaped so it can be encoded in Property Exchange JSON as either "/" or "\/".
      All characters which are not 7-bit ASCII characters shall be converted to UTF-16, and then escaped using

        "description": "This text contains double quote \" and new line \n characters."
    }

6.1.3 CommonMark
CommonMark [COMM01], a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown, is a method for
using plain text to display structured formatted text. It allows for simple screen devices to display the raw text
while more complex devices can render the text in a formatted way. Some string fields, such as "description" in
the ModeList Resource, will refer to supporting CommonMark.

6.1.4 Manufacturer-specific Properties
Manufacturers may wish to include their own specific information inside MMA/AMEI defined Resources (see
Section 8).
This shall be accomplished by including a manufacturer-specific Property with a name prefixed with "x-".
Manufacturer-specific properties shall conform to all other format rules defined by Property Exchange
specifications.
    Note: Manufacturer-specific properties that are contained within a Manufacturer/Device-Specific Resource do
    not need to be prefixed with "x-" (See Section 8.4).
Example of Property Data for a DeviceInfo Resource Inquiry including a Manufacturer Specific Property:
{
    "manufacturerId": [125,0,0],
    "manufacturer": "Educational Use",
    "familyId": [0,0],
    "family": "Example Range",
    "modelId": [48,0],
    "model": "Example Pedal",
    "versionId": [0,0,1,0],
    "version": "1.0",
    "x-uniqueKey": "myuniquevalue"
}

6.1.5 Non-JSON Data
Property Exchange allows devices to exchange Property Data that is not JSON compliant. If the Property Data is
not JSON as defined in Section 4.1, the associated Header Field shall include a "mediaType" Property to declare
the format of the Property Data (see Section 7.5).
Non-JSON Property Data shall be encoded to fit in the 7-bit data format of System Exclusive messages. Non-
JSON Property Data may also be compressed. See Section 6.2.3 for details of Compression and Encoding.

6.1.6 Compression and Encoding Property Data
Property Data may be JSON data (by default) or may be another data type (with a "mediaType" declared, see
Section 7.5). Regardless of data type, the Property Data field may optionally use compression and/or encoding if
both devices support that compression and/or encoding. The compression and/or encoding types supported by a
device shall be discovered using the ResourceList inquiry (See Section 9.1).
When the Property Data field contains a compressed and/or encoded payload, the Header Data field shall declare
the compression and/or encoding type.
The following table lists the supported compression and encoding formats in this version of Property Exchange.
The Property Value is the enum value used in Header fields (See Section 7) and in ResourceList (See Section
9.1) to declare encoding types.

  Mcoded7                  Encoded using Mcoded7 (See Section 4.3.1)

  zlib+Mcoded7             Compressed using zlib (RFC 1950 [EXT07]) with Mcoded7 encoding.


6.1.7 Mcoded7: 8-Bit to 7-Bit encoding
The default format of the Property Data field in Property Exchange message is JSON data in ASCII text as
defined in Section 6.1.1. Property Data which is not ASCII text as defined in Section 6.1.1 shall use the Mcoded7
format to encode 8-bit data to 7-bit.
Mcoded7 is also used in the File Dump format (without the name “Mcoded7”).
Description from the File Dump format from the MIDI 1.0 Specification [MA01]:
  Each group of seven stored bytes is transmitted as eight bytes. First, the sign bits of the seven bytes are sent,
  followed by the low-order 7 bits of each byte. (The reasoning is that this would make the auxiliary bytes appear
  in every 8th byte without exception, which would therefore be slightly easier for the receiver to decode.)
  The seven bytes:
      AAAAaaaa BBBBbbbb CCCCcccc DDDDdddd EEEEeeee FFFFffff GGGGgggg
  are sent as:
       0ABCDEFG
       0AAAaaaa 0BBBbbbb 0CCCcccc 0DDDdddd 0EEEeeee 0FFFffff 0GGGgggg
  From a buffer to be encoded, complete groups of seven bytes are encoded into groups of eight bytes. If the
  buffer size is not a multiple of seven, there will be some number of bytes leftover after the groups of seven are
  encoded. This short group is transmitted similarly, with the sign bits occupying the most significant bits of the
  first transmitted byte. For example:
       AAAAaaaa BBBBbbbb CCCCcccc
  are transmitted as:
       0ABC0000 0AAAaaaa 0BBBbbbb 0CCCcccc

6.2     Order of Processing for Compression and/or Encoding

6.2.1 Uncompressed and Unencoded JSON Property Data
When the Property Data is uncompressed and not encoded in Mcoded7, it shall be formatted using the following
steps:
1. Create the JSON object (as a string)
2. Escape all multi-byte and non-ASCII characters as defined in Section 6.1.1.
3. Break the output into individual chunks based on Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size (See MIDI-CI
    specification on how to retrieve this value from the Discovery Transaction.)
4. Send each chunk via MIDI-CI Property Exchange message(s).

6.2.2 Compressed and Encoded JSON Property Data
When the Property Data is zlib compressed and encoded in Mcoded7 (Mcoded7 is mandatory for zlib compressed
data), it shall be formatted using the following steps:
1. Create the JSON object (as a string)
2. Escape all multi-byte and non-ASCII characters as defined in Section 6.1.1.
3. Compress using zlib
4. Encode use Mcoded7
5. Break the output into individual chunks based on Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size (See MIDI-CI
    specification on how to retrieve this value from the Discovery Transaction.)
6. Send each chunk via MIDI-CI Property Exchange message(s).

6.2.3 Encoded Non-JSON Property Data
When Property Data is encoded it shall be formatted using the following steps:
1. Create the Property Data
2. Encode using Mcoded7
3. Break the output into individual chunks based on Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size (See MIDI-CI
    specification on how to retrieve this value from the Discovery Transaction.)
4. Send each chunk via a MIDI-CI Property Exchange message.

6.2.4 Compressed and Encoded Non-JSON Property Data
When the Property Data is zlib compressed and encoded in Mcoded7 (Mcoded7 is mandatory for zlib compressed
data), it shall be formatted using the following steps:
1. Create the Property Data
2. Compress using zlib
3. Encode use Mcoded7
4. Break the output into individual chunks based on Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size (See MIDI-CI
    specification on how to retrieve this value from the Discovery Transaction.)
5. Send each chunk via MIDI-CI Property Exchange message(s).

7 Header Data
7.1     Header Format Restrictions
The Header Data field shall contain properties in JSON format. Header Data shall conform to the rules defined for
Property Data in Section 6.1 and shall also conform to the additional set of rules and restrictions in Section 7.1.1.
      Note: Header Data shall be JSON data even if the associated Property Data is not JSON data.

7.1.1 JSON Header Data Property Additional Rules
Restrictions, in addition to the rules in Section 6.1.1, on the Header Data make it more easily readable by devices
with limited memory and processing power.
  • Properties shall be of type number, boolean, or string.
  • Described string Properties shall define a max length.
  • Property Key names shall use camelCase ASCII strings no longer than 20 chars.
  • For requests, the first Property shall be the Resource. For replies, the first Property shall be status. For
    subscription messages, the first Property shall be the command. In most cases no other data is needed.
  • The Header Data shall not include any whitespace characters such as space, tab, line feed, or newline. Header
    Data shall be all on one line.
      Note: these limitations only apply to JSON used in the Header Data (and not to JSON data in the Property
      Data field).

7.4   Reporting Status and Errors: Reply Header
Each MIDI-CI Property Exchange reply message shall include a status Property in the Header Data field. If the
status is any value other than 200, an associated message should be included.
The associated message is optional but recommended. If you include the message, you should use it to specify
why the status code was triggered, not what the status code means.
The message Header Data may be used to declare a successful Transaction. If a Responder successfully receives
and responds to an Inquiry: Set Property Data message, the Responder shall confirm with a value of 200 in the
"status" Property.
Example:
{"status":200}
The message Header Data may be used to report an error code with an associated message.
Example:
{"status":400,"message":"Inquiry Header does not specify the Resource."}

7.4.1 Table of status codes used in a Reply Message
The following is a list of Property Exchange status codes. Reply messages shall only use the Status codes that are
listed in this table and shall not use any other codes.
  Note: The Notify message uses other status codes. See Section 12 for details.

    445       Invalid Version of Data – Data is assumed valid, but the version of the data format is
               a version that the receiver cannot support. Example: the data might be intended
               for a newer version of software than the receiver, running a prior version of software, is able
              to use.

                         500-599 Server Error Responses – These are Major Errors
    500       Internal Device Error – A significant failure has occurred on the device.


7.4.2 Other Error Mechanisms
In addition to the errors defined above for use in a Reply message, Property Exchange provides mechanisms to
Terminate an Inquiry, perform a Timeout Wait, or report a Timeout condition by way of a Notify message. For
details see Section 12.
MIDI-CI also provides a NAK message that may be used with Property Exchange when it is not possible to return
a more informative error report as defined above. See the MIDI-CI specification for details.

7.4.3 cacheTime Header Property
This is the number of seconds that this Property Data should be cached by the Initiator. During this cacheTime,
the Initiator should use the cached Property Data. Only when the Initiator needs to access the Property Data after
the cacheTime has elapsed, it needs to request it again from the Responder to get the most up-to-date Property
Data. This optional feature reduces the load on the Responder by allowing Initiators to reuse the data without
making a second request.


                                     ©2020-2024 MMA and AMEI. All rights reserved.

                           M2-103-UM Common Rules for Property Exchange v1.2 2024-11-12


If the Resource Data has also been subscribed to and there is a notification that the data has changed, then
Subscription mechanisms override the cacheTime.
cacheTime is independent of each Property Exchange request Header.
When using pagination, a subset of Property Data is retrieved in one or more Property Exchange requests. Each
request has its own cacheTime.
      For example, retrieving the first 10 entries of a ProgramList Resource could return a cacheTimeof 30
      seconds, and the request for entries 11 to 20 could return a cacheTime of 60 seconds.
Implementations should implement cacheTime per request.
      In the example above, entries 1..10 will expire 30 seconds after receiving the response, and entries 11..20 will
      expire 60 seconds after the second response.
Some implementations may manage only one cacheTime per Resource, not per individual request. In this case,
the oldest cacheTime should be retained, even if partial Property Data is received with a renewed cacheTime.
Consequently, if by the time new partial Property Data is received, the oldest cacheTime is already expired, all
previously cached data should be removed and only the new partial Property Data with its cacheTime is valid for
this Resource.


7.5     Extra Header Property for Using Property Data which is Not JSON Data
If the associated Property Data is not JSON data which conforms to rules in Section 4.1, the Header Field shall

7.6     Header Properties to be Defined in the Future
Some Resources in the future may require new or unique Header Properties. All such Header Properties shall
comply with the rules in this Section 7.

8 Resources
A Resource is what determines how a request and response is structured. It tells the device how to act and what to
do.
Resource Format Rules:
• Resource names shall be nouns like DeviceInfo, Tempo, Mode
• Resource names shall not contain spaces and shall use Pascal Case (sometimes called “UpperCamelCase”) e.g.
  Channel list is "ChannelList" and tempo is "Tempo".

8.1   Resources Data Formats
By default, Resources shall be JSON compliant with the format rules and restrictions defined in Sections 4 and 5.
Resources may also contain other data which is not compliant with JSON only if the Resource declares a non-
JSON data type in the "mediaType" Property of the Header Field (see Sections 6.1 and 7.5).

8.2   Using Resources and Property Data
An Initiator sends an inquiry message with the Resource it wishes to retrieve declared in the Header Data field.
The Responder returns a reply message with the corresponding Property Data in the Property Data field.

                           Table 17 Initiator Sends Inquiry: Get Property Data
 Header Data         {"resource":"DeviceInfo"}

 Property Data       none

                         "version":"1.0"
                     }


8.3   MMA/AMEI Defined Resources
MMA/AMEI Resources should provide standardized mechanisms for a unified approach to common applications.
Resources defined by the MMA/AMEI shall describe the Properties that can be retrieved, the intent of the
Properties, implementation rules or guidelines, and how they relate with other Resources.
Resource specifications shall define which Properties are required and which Properties are optional. Properties
which are required, including strings marked as required, shall not be left empty.
See Section 9.2 and 9.3.

8.4    Custom, Manufacturer/Device-Specific Resources
Manufacturers may design devices that use custom Resources. The data format of custom Resources shall
conform to the standard style guides defined by Property Exchange.
All manufacturer/device-specific Resource names shall be prefixed with "X-". This is to avoid any overlap with
future defined Resources.
For Example:
X-MyCustomResource
  Note: Inside a Manufacturer/Device-Specific Resource (such as X-MyCustomResource), individual properties do
  not need to be prefixed with "x-" (See Section 4.1.3).

8.5    Resource ID
Resources may be defined to require a Resource ID ("resId") Property.
A Resource may have a selection of various entries, any one of which could be returned as the associated Property
Data for that specific Resource. Such Resources shall have a "resId" Property with a unique Property Value
assigned to each entry. Any inquiry for that Resource shall include a "resId" Property to select the desired entry.
If a Resource is defined to use the "resId" Property, then the Resource shall have the requireResId property set
to true in the ResourceList. See Section 12.

8.6    List Resources: Retrieving an Array of Objects
A List Resource is a specific type of Resource that provides a list of objects in a JSON array. Typical List
Resources include ProgramList and ChannelList.
The names of List Resources shall have the suffix “List”, e.g. "ProgramList"

8.6.1 Property Data in a Reply to a List Resource Inquiry
• A Reply to a List Resource shall be an array of objects
• Objects should only be one level deep. Objects, other than the "link" Property described below, may contain
  arrays or collections of integral values or strings and shall not contain other objects.
• List Resources can be complemented with additional Resources to access further, more detailed information that
  is not provided in the list. Objects in the reply to a List Resources may use a "link" Property to declare each
  Resource that is available for accessing more detailed information about a listed object. See Section 13.

8.6.2 Pagination
Pagination allows the Initiator to get a subset of the total list of objects available. Pagination uses the offset and
limit mechanism commonly used in JSON applications. Pagination support for each Resource shall be declared
using the "canPaginate":true Property in the ResourceList. See Section 14.2.1.
The "offset" and "limit" Properties may be used in the Header Data of an Inquiry: Get Property Data that
requests a List Resource. If pagination is used, both Properties shall be in the Header data of the inquiry:
                            Table 19 Header Properties used with Pagination

                              only)                         objects in the List Resource.
 limit                        number (integer, >=1          This specifies the maximum number of objects to be
                              only)                         returned.

All Responder replies to an Inquiry: Get Property Data message with a List Resource, when the Resource has
declared "canPaginate" in the ResourceList, shall contain a "totalCount" Property:

                                only)                        regardless of pagination.

The first Inquiry: Get Property Data message should request a list of entries starting from an offset of 0. The
Initiator may determine how to access the list of entries using pagination based on the "totalCount" Property
from the Responder and the "limit" Property chosen by the Initiator.

                          }
                     ]


If “offset” and “limit” properties are not used, the Property Data shall contain the whole list of all
objects.

9 Resources and Resource Data in a Device
Property Exchange specifications that are written to comply with this Common Rules for Property Exchange
specification define common Resource Data for MIDI Devices. They also define the relationship between some of
the Resource Data (or the relationship between Resources that access Resource Data). These Resource Data are
flexible enough to describe everything from keyboards, drums, samplers through to robotics and lighting.

9.1   ResourceList – Used Before Other PE Inquiries
An Initiator requests the ResourceList Resource in an Inquiry: Get Property Data message to retrieve a list of all
Resources that the Responder supports. This inquiry should be made before initiating any other Property
Exchange inquiries.
All Devices that support Property Exchange shall respond correctly to a ResourceList inquiry to report Resources
the Device supports.
ResourceList shall not be included in the response to a ResourceList inquiry.
For the full definition of ResourceList, see Section 14.

9.2   Foundational Resources Defined in other Specifications:
It is strongly recommended that all Devices should support the following Foundational Resources, defined in the
"MIDI-CI Property Exchange Foundational Resources: DeviceInfo, ChannelList, JSONSchema" specification
[MA04]. These Resources provide details about a device that will aid in auto configuration and provide useful
background data to help optimize many other Property Exchange inquiries. Some PE inquiries have dependencies
that require the prior use of these Resources.
• Device Information (DeviceInfo Resource) - This Resource Data provides fundamental information about a
  device. This contains data similar to the Device Inquiry Universal SysEx message. However, it also includes
  human-readable values for Manufacturer, Family, Model and Version information.
• Channels (ChannelList Resource) – The ChannelList Resource describes the current channels the device is
  transmitting and receiving across the whole Device. It describes for each Channel the Port of each Channel, and
  MPE status. It also describes for each receive Channel the current program and the ProgramList Resources
  available. In Devices that have more than one Mode, the current available channels can be significantly different
  in each Mode.

9.3   Other Resources Defined in other Specifications:
Other Resources are defined in other specifications published by AMEI/MMA. This Common Rules for Property
Exchange specification defines the rules for all other Resource specifications.

10 Full and Partial SET Inquiries
Property Exchange offers two methods for updating Resource Data or subsets of Resource Data:
• Method 1, Full SET: To update a whole set of Resource Data, an Initiator shall send an Inquiry: Set Property
  Data message. The Property Data field shall contain the whole Resource Data which would be sent by a
  Responder in a Reply to Get Property Data message. This may be used only if the target Resource declares a
  Property Value of "partial" or "full" for the "canSet" Property in the ResourceList (see Section 14).
• Method 2, Partial SET: For incremental changes or to change a subset of the Resource Data, an Initiator shall
  send an Inquiry: Set Property Data message. The Header Data field shall include "setPartial":true. In the
  Property Data field, each key of the update Resource Data shall represent a JSON Pointer (as per RFC 6901) to
  the Resource Data and provides a value. This value shall be a string, number, or boolean. This value shall not be
  an object or array. This may be used only if the target Resource declares a Property Value of "partial" for the
  "canSet" Property in the ResourceList (see Section 14).

10.1 Full SET Example:
A hypothetical Manufacturer defined Resource called "X-ProgramEdit" retrieves the following Resource Data
using an Inquiry: Get Property Data message:
                          Table 27 Initiator Sends Inquiry: Get Property Data
 Header Data         {"resource":"X-ProgramEdit","resId":"abcd"}

                             "lfoSpeed": 30,
                             "lfoWaveform": "triangle",
                             "pitchEnvelope": {
                                      "rates": [94,67,95,60],

                             }
                     }

The Initiator decides to upload a whole new program. The Initiator uses an Inquiry: Set Property Data message:

                     }

The Initiator makes a minor change to the LFO speed and only wants to send this change.

11 Subscribing to Property Data
A Subscription mechanism in PE may be used when an Initiator wants to keep Property Data of a Responder's
Resource synchronized between the Initiator and Responder. A subscription is only possible if it is supported by
both Initiator and Responder.
If a Responder declares that a subscription is available, the Initiator may subscribe to the Resource while it needs
ongoing, active access to the Property Data.
1. The Responder shall report in its reply to ResourceList that a Resource is subscribable. See Section 14.
2. The Initiator may subscribe to a subscribable Resource on the Responder using the Subscription message with a
    "start" command.
Subscriptions enable two-way communication of one set of Property Data:
  Responder: If any Property in the subscribed Property Data changes in the Responder, then the Responder shall
  inform the Initiator using a Subscription message with a "partial", "full", or "notify" command (See Section
  11).
  Examples:
        • If a MIDI Control Change message changes a Property Value in the Responder, the Responder sends
          the updated Property to the Initiator.
        • If a user sets a device parameter that changes a Property Value in the Responder, the Responder sends
          the updated Property to the Initiator.
        • If an Inquiry: Set Property Data message changes a Property Value in the Responder, the Responder
          sends the updated Property to the Initiator.


  Initiator: If any Property in the subscribed Resource Data changes in the Initiator, the Initiator shall take one of
  two optional actions to update the Property in the Responder:
      A. If the Initiator is able to send a MIDI message (such as a MIDI Control Change) to set the Property on
          the Responder, then it shall send the MIDI message.
      B. If the Initiator is not able to send a MIDI message to set the Property on the Responder, it shall send an
           Inquiry: Set Property Data.
  Example:
        • A visual program editor is open in a DAW. Editing data on the device will update the DAW to reflect
          those changes without the user having to manually refresh the data. This also works in reverse where
          the DAW can send very specific changes back to the device.


Each subscription update from the Responder shall be sent using a Subscription message.
Each reply to a Subscription message shall be sent using a Reply to Subscription message.
    Note: If a subscribed Resource has linked Resources (see Section 13), in some cases the Initiator may
    subscribe to the linked Resources in order to get additional, related updates.
    Note: There may be a delay between the Initiator sending the Inquiry: Set Property Data message and
    receiving a corresponding Subscription update reflecting the change from the Responder. When displaying the
    state of a Property to a user, a device should not display the duplication of data.

                                             This Subscription Id shall be used by the Responder

11.1.1 Selecting "partial", "full", or "notify"
When an individual Property or small number of Properties of the Property Data changes in the Responder, the
Responder should use a "command":"partial" Property.
When the complete Property Data or a substantial subset of the Property Data changes in the Responder, the
Responder should use a "command":"full" Property. The "command":"full" Property should be also used for all
Simple Property Resources.
Use of "command":"partial" and "command":"full" should be limited to only when the Property Data fits into a
single Property Exchange Message Chunk. If the Property Data spans multiple message Chunks, then the use of
"command":"notify" is recommended.

11.2 Replying to Subscription Messages
A device that receives a Subscription message for any subscribed Resource Data shall reply with a Reply to
Subscription message, so the original sender is aware of the success or failure of a command. If there is a failure,
the sender may decide to retry or end the Subscription by sending a Subscription Message with the "command"
Property set to "end".
If an Initiator receives but cannot handle a “partial” or “full”, the Initiator shall:
1. Return a Reply to Subscription message to report success in receiving the message.
2. Send an Inquiry: Get Property Data to remain synchronized with subscribed data of the Responder.

11.3 Setting the Property Data when Sending the "command" Property with the
     Property Value "full"
When Property Data is an array or object the Property Data for the update shall use the same format as data in a
Partial Inquiry: Set Property message (See Section 8).

A hypothetical Manufacturer defined Resource called "X-ProgramEdit" retrieves the following Resource Data
using an Inquiry: Get Property Data message:
                             Table 44 Initiator Sends Inquiry: Get Property Data
 Header Data        {"resource":"X-ProgramEdit","resId":"abcd"}

                         }
                    }

The X-ProgramEdit Resource in the ResourceList has previously declared the Resource to be subscribable with
the "canSubscribe" Property set to true.
The Initiator subscribes by sending a Subscription message:

The user hits a randomize button on the Responder Device. As there are numerous changes the Device decides to
notify the Initiator to get a complete new set of Resource Data:

11.5 Subscription End
If an Initiator no longer needs ongoing, active access to the Property Data, it should end the subscription.
A subscription should be considered active until any of the following events occur:
• The Initiator unsubscribes by sending a Subscription message with the "command" Property set to "end" to the
  Responder.
• The Responder ends a subscription by sending a Subscription message with the "command" Property set to "end"
  to the Initiator.
• An Invalidate MUID message is received with a Target MUID that matches the MUID of either the Initiator or
  the Responder, at which point all subscriptions are ended (without the use of an End Subscription message).

12 Terminating Transactions and Transaction Timeouts
Property Exchange provides mechanisms to Terminate an Inquiry, to inform that a timeout wait is occurring, or to
report a timeout condition by way of MIDI-CI ACK and NAK messages. These notifications may be sent by an
Initiator or a Responder.
MIDI-CI ACK and NAK messages include the Request ID of the Transaction which is being addressed by these
mechanisms.
See MIDI Capability Inquiry v1.2 [MA03] on how to send MIDI-CI ACK and NAK messages and for the use of
the Request Id.
MIDI-CI ACK and NAK messages replace the Notify message which was defined in prior Property Exchange
specifications. Some requirements of the Notify message remain for backward compatibility, as defined below.

A Responder may terminate a currently running Transaction by sending a MIDI-CI NAK message with a Status
Code = 0x20 and Status Data = 0x00.
If the Original Transaction Sub-ID#2 Classification field is set to 0x34 (MIDI-CI Inquiry: Get Property Data),
then the Initiator shall immediately stop expecting any further Chunks related to the declared Request Id.
If the Original Transaction Sub-ID#2 Classification field is set to 0x36 (MIDI-CI Inquiry: Set Property Data), then
the Initiator shall stop sending Chunks related to the declared Request Id.
Initiator and Responder shall immediately consider the Transaction concluded, without a reply from the Initiator.

12.1.2 MIDI-CI NAK: Initiator Terminates Transaction
An Initiator may inform a Responder that it has terminated a currently running Transaction by sending a MIDI-CI
NAK message with a Status Code is set to 0x20 and Status Data = 0x01.
If the Original Transaction Sub-ID#2 Classification field is set to 0x34 (MIDI-CI Inquiry: Get Property Data),
then the Responder shall immediately stop sending chunks related to the declared Request Id.
If the Original Transaction Sub-ID#2 Classification field is set to 0x36 (MIDI-CI Inquiry: Set Property Data, then
the Initiator shall stop expecting any further chunks related to the declared Request Id.
Initiator and Responder shall immediately consider the Transaction concluded without a reply from the
Responder.

12.1.3 Notify: Terminate Inquiry
The Notify: Terminate Inquiry message should not be sent. MIDI-CI NAK messages as defined in Sections 12.2.1
and 12.2.2 provide a superior mechanism. However, for backward compatibility, Property Exchange Receivers
(Initiators and Responders) shall terminate the currently running request in response to a Notify message with a
"status" Property with a value of 144. All inquiries related to the Request Id used shall cease immediately.
      Note: Previous versions of this specification had a different definition: Either device may terminate a
      currently running request by sending a Notify message with a "status" Property with a value of 144. All
      inquiries related to the Request Id used shall cease immediately.

12.2 Timeout
A Responder shall send a Reply to any Inquiry within the 3-seconds timeout period, unless the Responder requests
an extended time for processing.
MIDI-CI provides a mechanism for Property Exchange messages to be sent in multiple chunks. If a device sends a
message in multiple chunks, the time between consecutive chunks shall be under 3 seconds.

12.2.1 MIDI-CI ACK: Timeout Wait
If a Responder cannot generate and send either a suitable reply or a next Chunk of a Transaction within the default
3-second timeout, then it should send a MIDI-CI ACK message with the associated Request Id, a Status Code
0x10 (Timeout Wait), and a Status Data value indicating the timeout wait period to keep the current Transaction
active. The Status Data value specifies the additional timeout period in multiples of 100 milliseconds.
On reception, the Initiator shall extend its timeout period by at least the requested period (timeout wait period is
added to the current timeout period).
Example 1:
    A Responder receives an Inquiry, is processing that request, and is unable to begin the reply before the default
    timeout period (3 seconds). This Responder needs at most a further 6 seconds (9 seconds total). The
    Responder sends a MIDI-CI ACK message with a Status Code of 0x10 and Status Data of 0x3C (6 seconds).
Example 2:
    A Responder has already sent some data and is building the next Chunk in a reply, and is unable to send the
    next Chunk before the timeout period. The Responder sends a MIDI-CI ACK message with a Status Code =
    0x10 and Status Data = 0x1E to extend the timeout period by a further 3 seconds.

12.2.2 Notify: Timeout Wait (deprecated)
Use of the Notify: Timeout Wait message has been deprecated, and future implementations should instead use the
MIDI-CI ACK as defined in 12.2.1. However, for backward compatibility, a Receiver should handle a received
Notify message with status 100 the same as the newer ACK Timeout Wait message as defined in section 12.2.1
      Note: Previous versions of this specification had a different definition: If a Responder has already sent some
      data and is building the next chunk in a reply, and if it cannot send the next chunk before the timeout period,
      the Responder may send a Notify message with a "status" Property with a value of 100.

 Header Data         {"status":100}

 Property Data       None

      Note: This message has been deprecated, and future implementations should use the MIDI-CI ACK
      methods in 11.3.1

12.2.3 MIDI-CI NAK: Timeout Has Occurred
If an Initiator does not receive an expected reply, a next Chunk, or a Timeout Wait message within the timeout
period, the Initiator may terminate the Transaction by sending a MIDI-CI NAK with Status Code = 0x42.
Initiator and Responder shall immediately consider the Transaction concluded, without a reply from the
Responder.

12.2.4 Notify: Timeout Has Occurred
Use of the Notify: Timeout Has Occurred message has been deprecated, and future implementations should
instead use the MIDI-CI ACK method as defined in 12.2.3. However, for backward compatibility, a device should
handle a received Notify message with status 408 the same as the newer NAK Timeout Has Occurred message as
defined in section 12.2.3.
      Note: Previous versions of this specification had a different definition: If a Responder cannot generate a
      suitable reply or next chunk in a message within the timeout period, it may send a Notify message with a
      "status" Property with a value of 408 to cancel the inquiry.
      If an Initiator does not receive an expected Reply, next message chunk, or a Notify: Timeout Wait message
      within the timeout period, it may terminate the inquiry by sending a Notify message with a "status" Property
      with a value of 408.

The role Property indicates how a Link will be used:
Examples:
• To use additional, related Properties.
• To use an additional component.
• To select an additional component from a list.
• To open a graphic editor.

In order to use the first link in the data above, the Initiator sends an Inquiry: Get Property Data message using the
associated "resId" Property.

                         ]
                     }

In this example two links are available. The Initiator may choose to present this information to the user.

         Educational Use: MIDI-CI Test Workbench

        BPM                                                120↕

The Tempo and LocalOn Resources in this example are Simple Property Resources (See Section 8.7) and are
shown as editable in line.

13.1 Using a "role" Property of a Link
A Resource may have a close connection to or a dependency on another Resource. The two Resources might be
used together to achieve a larger set of goals. Or one Resource might naturally lead to the use of another Resource
in a user's typical workflow.
A Resource may use optional "links" Property to declare these connections to other related Resources. Within
each Link entry, an optional "role" Property declares the purpose of the Link. In this specification, the role
declares that a Link is used as an Action. An Action presents the user with the ability to trigger a function on a
Device. Triggered Actions may change a Device's state, settings, or configuration. Those changes might cause a
change in the Property Data of the Device's Resources.
A Responder should only declare Roles which the Responder has the ability to process. An Initiator shall only use
Roles that are declared by the Responder.

13.1.1 Role: simpleAction
A Property Exchange Link which contains a role Property with the value of simpleAction is used to indicate to
the Initiator that there is an option for a user to trigger a Resource defined action. An Action is often displayed as
a button for a user to press.
Example Simple Actions which might be used include:
  • Internally Copy (or paste) the current entry from a Resource List
  • Initialize or delete data
  • Save changes
  • Launch an internal function that cannot be triggered by Channel Voice Messages
  • Other function(s) defined by any Resource
The simpleAction may directly trigger the Action, or may present a confirmation dialog box. This optional dialog
box presents the user with the choice to proceed with or cancel the Action.
An activated Action shall use an Inquiry: Set Property Data message. The Property Data used is the data contained
in the "propData" Property contained in the Link entry.
The Header Data in the Reply to Set Property Data message may contain an optional "msg" Property which is a
text string that should be displayed to the user.

The Initiator would likely display the ProgramList Property Data similar to the following:


                           Title                       Copy                           Paste

                    Figure 3 Example of Initiator displaying simpleAction Roles

An initiator understands that the copy and paste are buttons because the "role" Property has the value of
"simpleAction"
When the button is pressed the "resource" and "resId" (if provided) are used in an Inquiry: Set Property Data
Message:


                  Table 70 Initiator Sends an Inquiry: Set Property Data Message

The Property Data string in the Response is displayed to the user. If the Property Data is empty, then the user is
not displayed any message.

13.1.2 Role: selectorAction
A Property Exchange Link may provide options for user selection. The Link entry shall include three parts:
• A "role" Property with the value of "selectorAction".
• A List Resource ("resource" and "resid") that contains two or more user selectable options.
• An Action Resource ("actionResource" and "actionResId") that is the target of the options. This Resource
  shall be a Simple Property Resource.
The Initiator might display the selectorAction as a button which, when enacted, displays the available options to
the user. The user may select a single option from this list. This selection is then used with the Action Resource.


Examples of Selector Actions which might be presented:
• Audio files available to be used in a loop
• An arpeggiator style to apply

*only required when role Property value is "selectorAction"
When a user selects a List Resource entry, the Initiator shall send an Inquiry: Set Property Data message to set the
associated Resource which is declared in the “actionResource” property. The Property Data used is discovered
by looking at the "selectedProperty" Property Value, and finding the matching Property Key in the selected
List Resource entry. The Property Data must match the schema of the associated Resource.
The Header Data in the Reply to Set Property Data message may contain an optional "msg" Property which is a
text string that should be displayed to the user.

13.1.2.1 Example Selection of an Audio output on the ChannelList Resource from a
         Manufacturer defined List Resource
A Device might allow users to select an audio output assignment for each MIDI Channel. The example device
uses 2 MIDI Channels, Piano and Bass, so there are two "selectorAction" Roles available. The example follows
the transactions when the user decides to set the audio output for the Piano part.

The Initiator discovers the existence of a Piano channel and a Bass channel in the Responder, each with selectable
audio output assignments.

Step 2: Initiator Displays to the User
  The Initiator would likely display the ChannelList Property Data, with a button to display audio output
  assignment selection for each of the two channels:



                         Channel                      Title                   Channel Output

                     Figure 4 Example of Initiator displaying selectAction Roles


Step 3: User Selects a selectorAction Button
When the "Stereo Main" button is pressed on Channel 1, the Link "resource" and "resId" Properties, previously
declared in the ChannelList Property Data above, are used in an Inquiry: Get Property Data message to request
the X-AudioOutList.

                  Table 74 Initiator Sends an Inquiry: Get Property Data Message

Step 4: Initiator Displays to the User
The Initiator would likely display the X-AudioOutList Property Data as list of available audio outputs selections:



                                    Output                                Selected

                                 Right Main                                    ❏

                                Stereo Main                                    ☑

                                   Left Alt                                    ❏

                                  Right Alt                                    ❏

                     Figure 5 Example of Initiator displaying selectAction Roles


Step 5: User Selects an Audio Output
If the user decides to select the "Left Alt" Resource List item by clicking on the table row, then the Initiator sends
an Inquiry: Set Property Data message with the "resource" and "resId" Properties from the "actionResource"
Property in the Link entry.
In this example the X-AudioOutList List Resource entry selected is:
{"output": "LA", "name": "Left Alt", "selected": false}
The "selectProperty" Property Value is "output". The "output" Property Value from the entry is "LA". This is
used as the Property Data.

                  Table 76 Initiator Sends an Inquiry: Set Property Data Message
 Header Data          {"resource":"X-Output","resId":"ch1"}

 Property Data        "LA"

The Responder performs the Initialize Program function and returns a reply.
                       Table 77 Initiator Sends Reply to Subscription Message
 Header Data          {"status":200,"message":"The Output of Channel 1 is set to Left Alt."}

 Property Data        none

The process for selecting the audio output for Channel 1 is finished.

13.2 Subscriptions and Linked Resources
When a subscription to a Resource is established, linked Resources are not automatically included in the
subscription. If the Initiator also needs to subscribe to a linked Resource, an additional subscription is required.
In general, an Initiator does not need to subscribe to a linked Resource until it accesses the link and begins
ongoing, active use of the linked Resource.

14 Resource: ResourceList
The "ResourceList" Resource provides a comprehensive method for an Initiator to understand how to control the
Responder using Property Exchange. Response to ResourceList is mandatory for all devices that support
Property Exchange.
When a Responder receives an Inquiry: Get Property Data message with "ResourceList" the Responder shall
send a Reply to Get Property Data message with a list of all Resources it supports so the Initiator understands its
availability and settings. (ResourceList is itself a List Resource.)
Each Resource listed provides various qualifiers on how that Resource can be used, such as being able to use
Inquiry: SET Property Data or Subscription messages. Resources defined by AMEI/MMA specifications have
defined default settings so that devices can have a shorter ResourceList. Devices may override individual settings
as needed.
ResourceList is usually the first inquired Resource before requesting any other Property Exchange Resource. The
reply to ResourceList shall include all the MMA/AMEI and Manufacturer defined Resources supported by a
device. The ResourceList Property Data returned shall not include an entry for ResourceList itself in the list of

14.2 Property Data for ResourceList Returned via a Reply to Get Property Data
     Message
When a Responder receives an Inquiry: Get Property Data message with a ResourceList request, the Responder
sends a Reply to Inquiry: Get Property Data message with an array of objects in the Property Data field. Each
object in the array declares a Resource which is supported by the Responder.
The structure of objects in a reply to a ResourceList request are as follows:

*AMEI/MMA Resources have JSON Schemas. However, they do need to be declared in ResourceList.

14.2.1 Additional Properties for List Resources
Any Resource which is a List Resource declared as an entry in the ResourceList Property Data shall include the
following additional Properties if they are applicable to that List Resource.

14.3 Minimized Listing of AMEI/MMA Defined Resources in ResourceList using
     Default Values
Each ResourceList object includes a set of Properties that explain the details about how that particular Resource
may be used on the Device. Many of those Properties define a default value within the range of allowed Property
Values.
If a Device’s implementation uses the default value for a Property, then that Property is not required to be
included in the ResourceList object.
If a Device’s implementation does not use the default value for a Property, then the ResourceList object shall
include the Property and Property Value to declare a value which overrides the default value.
The default values for "schema", "requireResId", "canPaginate", "canSet", "canGet" Properties shall not be
overridden on AMEI/MMA defined Resources unless the specification for that Resource specifically defines an
allowance for overriding.

14.4 Schema Property for Manufacturer Specific JSON Resources
AMEI/MMA standardized Resources do not require exchange of a JSON Schema and shall not be overridden.
Manufacturer-specific JSON Resources shall supply at least a simple JSON Schema. The JSON Schema shall
supply at least “title" and “type". Including these 2 objects is enough to meet the minimum requirement.
Supplying a fully descriptive JSON Schema is optional.
For devices that want to exchange a more complete JSON Schema, conformance to JSON Schema draft 4 is
recommended. Other revisions of JSON Schema may be declared using the "$schema" property.

14.4.1 Including a Schema Property in the ResourceList
Any Manufacturer-specific JSON Resources that has a simple structure or is a Simple Property Resource may
include the complete JSON Schema in a "schema" Property.

                        {

                            "canSet":"full",
                            "schema":{
                                "title":"WIFI Enabled",

                         }
                    ]


14.4.2 Providing a Reference to an Expanded JSON Schema in the ResourceList
It is recommended that Manufacturer Specified Resources use a reference to supply a fully descriptive JSON
Schema for complex data. JSON Schema provides "$ref" keyword in the "schema" Property to support this
concept.
From JSON Schema: "The value of $ref is a URI, and the part after # sign (the “fragment” or “named anchor”) is
in a format called JSON Pointer."
To indicate that the JSON Schema comes from the device, the following URI scheme is used:
"midi+jsonschema://<JSON Schema Id>"

 Property Data      [
                        {
                              "resource":"X-Globset",
                              "canSet":"full",
                              "schema":{
                                  "title":"System Settings",
                                  "description":"Set the global settings here",
                                  "type":"object",
                                  "$ref":"midi+jsonschema://globalSchema"
                              }
                        }
                    ]

To retrieve a JSON Schema an Initiator may send an Inquiry: Get Property Data message with the Resource set to
"JSONSchema".
  Note: The JSONSchema Resource is defined in the Foundational and Basic Resources specification.

                         }
                     }


14.5 Using Columns for List Resources
The "columns" Property may be used to describe a table for presenting selected data from a List Resource.
The "columns" Property contains an array of objects. Each object becomes a column in the table. Each object in
the array contains a "property" or "link", and a "title".
       Table 90 Example ResourceList Object Record Containing a "columns" Property
 Property Data       [
                         {
                             "resource": "ChannelList",
                             "canSubscribe": true,
                             "columns":[
                                 {"property": "channel", "title": "MIDI Channel"},
                                 {"property": "programTitle", "title": "Program Name"},
                                 {"link":"CMList", "title": "Controllers"}
                             ]
                         }
                     ]

Property Value of "title" in each object becomes the title for each column in the table.
In this example, we get the title for three columns: channel, programTitle, and CMList.

Each entry in the List Resource provides the data for a row in the table. The data chosen to populate each field of a
row is determined by the columns array.
In this example, the columns array above lists three items to fill the three fields of a row, two "property" items
and a "link" item to be used from each entry in the List Resource:
  "channel"
  "programTitle"
  "CMList"
The data from the columns array and the List Resource in this example combine to generate the following table.

14.6 ResourceList properties for non-JSON Resources
Property Exchange does not use the schema "type" property which is usually found in a JSON Schema because
the "type" property does not support the necessary media types. That schema "type" property shall be left empty
in any JSON Schema used for PE. Instead, the "mediaType" Property of the PE Header Data shall declare the data
type.
The "schema" shall still provide the "title" Property of the Resource.

15 Flow Control
Property Exchange contains a chunking mechanism as a way for Property Data to split over many Inquiry: Get
Property Data or Inquiry: Set Property Data SysEx packets. A Device that is receiving information might
experience a loss of data when buffers are full and the Device is not able to receive additional data. In Property
Exchange this might occur on the receiving Device when it is unable to keep up with chunks sent due to internal
processing.
Missing chunks in a small Property Data is easily managed, as the Transaction can be restarted. In larger payloads
this becomes quite disruptive to the user. For example, some binary Property Data may require 1000 chunks or
more. If chunk 882 fails, then the user will have to start the Transaction again.
A Receiver may mitigate these problems by sending Property Exchange Flow Control MIDI-CI ACK between
each Chunk from the Device receiving the Chunks. When the Sender Device receives Property Exchange Flow
Control MIDI-CI ACK, the Sender sends the next Chunk.
To use Flow Control, the following steps are used:
1. Initiator declares that Flow Control shall be used by including a "flowControl":true in the Property
     Exchange Header Data. This applies whether the Initiator will be the Sender or Receiver.
2. Sender sends Chunk 1
3. Receiver sends back MIDI-CI ACK for Chunk 1 using a Status Code = 0x11 (Chunk received and processed.
    Send next Chunk).
4. Sender sends the next Chunk.
Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until all Chunks are received.
5. To determine the final step, see Section 15.2 and 15.3.
  This method also allows a receiver to request a resend of all parts of the last set of Chunks sent, if it has an
  internal failure or the Chunk Property Data is corrupted. (See Section 15.4 below)

15.1 Flow Control MIDI-CI ACK Message

15.2 Using Flow Control with Inquiry: Get Property Data
To use Flow Control with an Inquiry: Get Property Data, the MIDI-CI PE Header Data "flowControl" Property
indicates the Transaction should use Property Exchange Flow Control MIDI-CI ACK messages.
          Table 95 Example of using Flow Control an Inquiry: Get Property Data Message
 Header         {"resource":"State","resId":"buffer","mutualEncoding":"Mcoded7","flowControl":true}
 Data
 Property       none
 Data

If the "flowControl" Property is not set to true, then the Responder shall return the Property Data without waiting
for the Initiator to send a MIDI-CI ACK message between Chunks.
If the "flowControl" Property is used on a Resource that does not support Flow Control, then an error should be
returned using a "status":406 in the Reply to Inquiry Get message.
A MIDI-CI ACK is required on the Last Chunk in an Inquiry: Get Property Data Message and is used to
acknowledge that all chunks have been received.

15.3 Using Flow Control with Inquiry: Set Property Data
To use Flow Control with an Inquiry: Set Property Data the MIDI-CI PE Header Data "flowControl" Property
indicates the Transaction should use Property Exchange Flow Control MIDI-CI ACK messages.

 Data
If the "flowControl" Property is not set to true on a Resource that has declared "fcOnSet":true, then an error
should be returned using a "status":407 in the Reply to Inquiry Get message.
If the "flowControl" Property is used on a Resource that does not support Flow Control, then an error should be
returned using a "status":406 in the Reply to Inquiry Get message.
A MIDI-CI ACK is not required on the Last Chunk in an Inquiry: Set Property Data Message as the Reply to Set
Data Message is used to acknowledge that all chunks have been received.
  Note: A Sender should not discard the transmitted data until you receive the ACK so it can be retransmitted if
  required.

15.4 Sending a Retransmit MIDI-CI NAK Message

15.5 Timeouts when using Flow Control
A Sender of Property Data may experience timeouts when waiting for a MIDI-CI ACK. When using Flow
Control, if a MIDI-CI ACK is not received within 3 seconds after sending a Chunk, then the Sender should
attempt to resend the Chunk. If that fails 3 times, then the Sender should fail and send a MIDI-CI NAK Terminate
Message (see Section 12.1).
A Receiver of Property Data may experience timeouts. Both the Sender and Receiver shall use the methods
described in Section 12.2 to manage timeouts and terminate appropriately if the timeout is not resolved.
