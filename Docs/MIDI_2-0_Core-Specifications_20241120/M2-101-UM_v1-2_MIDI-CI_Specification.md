                                     MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI)

          MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) is a set of bidirectional mechanisms which allow
          devices to negotiate with each other for autoconfiguration. MIDI-CI also allows the
          expansion of MIDI with new features while protecting backward compatibility with
          MIDI Devices that do not understand these newly defined features.

1         Introduction
1.1       Executive Summary
MIDI is a longstanding and entrenched specification. The features of MIDI 1.0 continue to work well after many
years. The basic semantic language of music does not change and as a result the existing definitions of MIDI as
musical control messages continue to work remarkably well.
MIDI 2.0 expands the feature set and capabilities of MIDI.
There are several key hurdles and requirements to consider as we make any additions to MIDI:
      • Backwards compatibility is a key requirement. Users expect new MIDI Devices to work seamlessly with
        MIDI Devices sold in previous decades.
      • All MIDI Status Bytes in MIDI 1.0 are defined. The opcodes and data payloads are defined. It is difficult to
        add new mechanisms, define any new messages or change the format of the existing MIDI messages.
To protect backwards compatibility in an environment with expanded features, Devices need to confirm the
capabilities of other connected Devices. When two Devices are connected to each other, they use MIDI 1.0
compatible messages to confirm each other’s capabilities before using new features. If both Devices share support
for the same expanded MIDI features, they can agree to use those expanded MIDI features. MIDI-CI provides this
mechanism.
MIDI-CI: Solution for Expanding MIDI while Protecting Backwards Compatibility:
MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) is a mechanism which allows expansion of MIDI with new features while
protecting backward compatibility with MIDI Devices that do not understand these newly defined features.
MIDI-CI separates older MIDI products from newer products with new capabilities and provides a mechanism for
two MIDI Devices to understand what new capabilities are supported.
MIDI-CI assumes and requires bidirectional communication. Once a MIDI-CI connection is established between
Devices, query and response messages define what capabilities each Device has. MIDI-CI then negotiates or auto-
configures to use those features that are common between the Devices.
MIDI-CI includes queries for three major areas of expanded MIDI functionality:
      1. Profile Configuration
      2. Property Exchange
      3. Process Inquiry

1.2       Background
MIDI-CI defines an architecture that allows Devices with bidirectional communication to agree to use extended
MIDI capabilities beyond those defined in MIDI 1.0, while carefully protecting backward compatibility. If a
Device does not support new features, MIDI continues to work as defined by MIDI 1.0. Goals of MIDI-CI design
include:
      1. Fully backward compatible: supports continued MIDI 1.0 functionality for any Devices that do not
          recognize extended MIDI features enabled by MIDI-CI.
      2. Allow easy configuration between MIDI-CI Devices.
      3. Sender can know the capabilities of a Receiver.
      4. Sender and Receiver can negotiate auto-configuration details.
      5. Define method for using Profiles.
      6. Define method for Discovering, Getting, and Setting a wide range of Device Properties.
      7. Define method for retrieving information about the current MIDI Message values from a Device.

 A MIDI-CI Discovery Transaction informs the MIDI system that a device exists on a connection and provides
fundamental, identifying data which is very useful for system configuration.
Even devices that do not implement any Category of MIDI-CI negotiations (Profile Configuration, Property
Exchange, or Process Inquiry) are encouraged to use MIDI-CI Discovery. The central feature of the minimum
requirements is the ability to Send and Respond to MIDI-CI Discovery messages.

1.3       Changes in this Version of MIDI-CI
This version contains all errata and feature changes or additions since MIDI-CI version 1.1 [MA03]. The most
significant changes include:
      • Added features for backward and forward compatibility through future update versions. To ensure
        compatibility with previous and future MIDI-CI versions, every MIDI-CI implementation shall follow the
        rules defined in Section 5.4.
      • Deprecated Protocol Negotiation.
        These mechanisms have been replaced by UMP Endpoint mechanisms defined in the M2-104-UM
        Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format and MIDI 2.0 Protocol, Version 1.1 specification [MA06].
             • Removed Bidirectional Settings and Authority Level sections (were only used by Protocol
               Negotiation).
      • Added Section 9, Process Inquiry. This version of MIDI-CI introduces a new category of MIDI-CI, Process
        Inquiry, which allows an Initiator to discover the current state of supported MIDI Messages including:
             • System Messages
             • Channel Controller Messages
             • Note Data Messages
      • Added Section 7.6, Profile Details Inquiry Message
        The Profile Details Inquiry message is used by an Initiator to discover details of the Profile implementation
        of a Responder. For example, an Initiator might discover:
             • How many Channels may be used or assigned by the Responder for a multi-channel Profile.
             • The Note Range supported by the Responder for the Profile.
             • Which optional Profile features the Responder is capable of supporting.
        The details which may be discovered are defined by the specification for the requested Profile Id.
      • Added Profile Added Report and Profile Removed Report List messages.
      • Added Section 3.1, Function Blocks.
        A Device may have one or more Function Blocks. A Function Block is a single functional component or
        application that operates on a set of one or more Groups. Function Blocks are used to separate a Device's
        functional components into manageable units.
      • Expanded addressing capabilities due to the addition of Function Blocks.
      • Fixed an error in the SubID#2 for the Invalidate MUID message in MIDI-CI Version 1.1 [MA03]. The
        specification defined a SubID#2 with value 0x7E, while the table in the final Appendix listed it as 0x72.
        The value 0x7E is the correct value.

MIDI 2.0 Protocol specification [MA06].
Initiator: One of two MIDI-CI Devices with a bidirectional communication between them. Initiator has the
management role of setting and negotiating parameters for interoperability between the two Devices. The primary
goal of Initiator is usually (but not strictly required to be) configuring two Devices for subsequent communication
from Initiator as MIDI transmitter to Responder as MIDI receiver. The role of Initiator and Responder may
alternate between the two MIDI-CI Devices. Either MIDI-CI Device may initiate a MIDI Transaction (act as
Initiator) at any time. Also see Responder.
Inquiry: A message sent by an Initiator to begin a Transaction.

2         Topology
2.1       Bidirectional
MIDI-CI requires bidirectional MIDI communications.




                                    Figure 2 Bidirectional Communication
Every MIDI-CI capable Input shall be paired with a matching Output. Devices may have multiple pairs of MIDI
Inputs and Outputs.
Each pair of Input + 1 Output is used for MIDI-CI Transactions.
See Appendix C: for topology limitations related to MIDI Thru and MIDI merge functions.

2.2       Initiator and Responder Relationship
MIDI-CI assumes that MIDI communications tend to be Receiver centric; MIDI-CI assumes a system where a
MIDI Sender “learns” something about the Receiver and adapts its output as much as possible to support the
capabilities of the Receiver.
However, through MIDI-CI negotiation mechanisms, a Sender can also ask a Receiver to enable features reported
as supported capabilities to adapt the Receiver to the capabilities of the Sender.
In a MIDI-CI bidirectional connection, both Devices are Senders and both Devices are Receivers for various
MIDI-CI messages that constitute a Transaction. Therefore, Initiator and Responder are terms used to clarify the
relationship between the two MIDI Devices for a specific MIDI-CI Transaction with a bidirectional connection.
Either of the two Devices may choose to function as the Initiator for a MIDI-CI Transaction.
      • The Initiator takes on the management role of setting and negotiation of parameters in the Transaction for
        interoperability between the two Devices. The primary goal of Initiator is usually (but not strictly required
        to be) configuring two Devices for subsequent communication from Initiator as MIDI Sender to Responder
        as MIDI Receiver.
      • If a Device which has been acting as a Responder also wants to set parameters for communication, then the
        Responder may act as an Initiator for subsequent MIDI-CI Transactions to manage the configuration of the
        two Devices.
    Example: MIDI Device 1 starts as Initiator Device by sending a Profile Inquiry and the MIDI Device 2 acts as
    Responder and answers with a Reply to Profile Inquiry. Then MIDI Device 1 may send messages to enable and
    disable Profiles on MIDI Device 2. If MIDI Device 2 wishes to control Profiles on MIDI Device 1 (that is the
    opposite direction), then it shall take on the role of Initiator, and initiate a Profile Inquiry.

3         Message Addressing and MUID
MIDI-CI messages are exchanged between Devices using addresses or routing determined by a combination of:
      1. An established Bidirectional MIDI connection
            • Any Function Blocks discovered in establishing the connection
      2. The UMP Format Group Field
            • Any Function Blocks which have the Group as a member
      3. System Exclusive Device ID Fields
      4. MIDI-CI Devices’ MUIDs

3.1       Function Blocks
A Device may have one or more Function Blocks. A Function Block is a single functional component or
application that operates on a set of one or more Groups. Function Blocks are used to separate a Device's
functional components into manageable units. See the M2-104-UM Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format and
MIDI 2.0 Protocol specification [MA06].
Each Function Block that supports MIDI-CI shall have a different MUID and act as a unique MIDI-CI Device
(See Section 3.3.1).
MIDI-CI Messages that are meant for a specific Function Block, Group in a Function Block, or Channel in a
Group, are sent using the UMP Group Field that the MIDI-CI Message is addressing. (For more details of
addressing MIDI-CI messages, See Section 5.2.1.)
If a UMP Endpoint does not declare any Function Block topology, then the user has less information on how to
configure the Devices to be on matching Group (and Channel) addresses for communication.
MIDI-CI Devices that use the MIDI 1.0 data format do not use the UMP Format and therefore will not have
Groups or Function Blocks.

3.1.1 USB MIDI 2.0 Group Terminal Blocks
The USB MIDI 2.0 Specification version 1.0 [USBIF02] describes the use of Group Terminal Blocks to declare the
entities that operate on a set of one or more Groups. MIDI-CI treats Group Terminal Blocks like Function Blocks.
Each Group Terminal Block should have its own MUID. Also see the M2-104-UM Universal MIDI Packet
(UMP) Format and MIDI 2.0 Protocol specification [MA06].
The USB MIDI 2.0 specification describes the bMIDIProtocol value 0x00 as "Unknown (Use MIDI-CI)".
However, the Protocol Negotiation mechanisms in MIDI-CI have been deprecated. MIDI-CI Protocol Negotiation
has been replaced by Endpoint Discovery, Endpoint Info Notification, Stream Configuration Request, and Stream
Configuration Notification mechanisms defined in the M2-104-UM Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format and
MIDI 2.0 Protocol specification [MA06].

3.2       MIDI-CI Addressing
MIDI messages sent in the MIDI 1.0 data format can be addressed to any one of sixteen Channels (for example
Note On/Off, controllers, etc.) or to the whole MIDI Endpoint (System messages).
MIDI 2.0 and the Universal MIDI Packet Format expand on the available addresses, with sixteen Channels in each
of sixteen Groups. These sixteen Groups are addressed on a single UMP Endpoint. One or more Groups which are
used together for a common function are members of a Function Block.
MIDI-CI provides mechanisms for all these addresses.

3.2.1 MIDI-CI Addressing in MIDI 1.0 Data Format Connections
The Device ID field of Universal System Exclusive MIDI-CI Messages is used for addressing:
      • 0x00-0x0F map to MIDI Channels 1-16
      • 0x7E is addressed to the whole MIDI Endpoint, not channelized.
      • 0x7F is addressed to the whole MIDI Endpoint, not channelized, and treated as a Function Block with only
        one member Group.
Whether the Device ID refers to the Source or Destination depends on the definition of each message type. See
Section 5.2.1 and individual messages for more details.

3.2.2 MIDI-CI Addressing in UMP Format Connections
MIDI-CI messages in the UMP Format are addressed according to the combination of two fields in the message:
the UMP Group field and the Universal System Exclusive Device ID field.
The UMP Group field identifies:
      • A specific Group
Values in the Device ID field of Universal System Exclusive MIDI-CI Messages are used for further addressing:
      • 0x00-0x0F map to MIDI Channels 1-16 in the UMP Group
      • 0x7E addresses to the UMP Group (not channelized)
      • 0x7F addresses any Function Block which has the UMP Group as a member, or if there are no Function
        Blocks declared then to the UMP Group and treated as a Function Block with only one member Group.
Whether the Device ID refers to the Source or Destination depends on the definition of each message type. See
Section 5.2.1 and individual messages for more details.

3.3       MIDI-CI MUID
MUID is a 28-bit random number generated by a MIDI-CI Device used to uniquely identify MIDI-CI messages to
or from a Function Block or other functional entity of that Device. All MIDI-CI messages include the MUID of
the source Function Block and the MUID of the destination Function Block. For more information about Function
Blocks see Section 3.1.
The value of the MUID shall be in the range 0x00000000 to 0x0FFFFFFF.
The values 0x0FFFFF00 to 0x0FFFFFFE are reserved.
The value 0x0FFFFFFF is used as a Broadcast MUID (see Section 3.3.3).
MIDI-CI provides a mechanism to associate a MUID with a Function Block (See Section 5.6.2). For more
information about Function Blocks see Section 3.1.

3.3.1 Generating a MUID
Every time a MIDI-CI Device is powered up, it shall create a new, randomly generated MUID for each Function
Block. The MIDI-CI Device shall use this same MUID for every Transaction until the Device is shut down and
restarted or until it receives an Invalidate MUID message on that Function Block (see Section 5.6.1) for that
MUID. When a Device is restarted it shall generate new MUIDs for each Function Block.
A MIDI-CI Device shall not use the same MUID every time it restarts.
If a MUID for a Function Block is changed (invalidated and a new MUID is generated) the Device shall send a
Function Block Info Change Alert UMP Message (See the M2-104-UM Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format
and MIDI 2.0 Protocol specification [MA06]).
The chances of a collision of MUID, where more than one Device on a MIDI connection selects the same MUID,
is greatly reduced if all MIDI-CI Devices use good random number generators for their MUIDs (see Appendix
A:).

3.3.2 Invalidating a MUID
MUIDs may be invalidated for several reasons, including but not limited to:
    • MIDI-CI Device is shutting down or rebooting.
    • MUID Collision – In the rare case that a collision does occur, MIDI-CI provides rules and mechanisms for
      resolving the collision (see Sections 5.9.1 and 5.9.2).
    • If a Function Block or other functional entity of a MIDI-CI Device changes its Group location or number of
      Groups, the Device shall invalidate the MUID (See Section 5.9). After the change the Device shall generate
      a new MUID and establish a new MIDI-CI connection (See Section 4).

3.3.3 Broadcast MUID
Certain MIDI-CI messages are defined to use a Broadcast MUID as a replacement for a specific MUID. This
Broadcast MUID is used because the sender of a MIDI-CI message does not know the MUID of a potential
receiver, or because the intended destination of the message is several Receivers.
Broadcast MUID = 0x0FFFFFFF (expressed as 4 bytes of 7-bit data in MIDI-CI message: 0x7F 0x7F 0x7F 0x7F)
Messages sent to the Broadcast MUID shall not be larger than 512 bytes or shall have a defined chunking
mechanism so the buffers of any connected receivers will not overflow.
The Broadcast MUID shall be used only for the following MIDI-CI Messages:
    • Discovery
    • Invalidate MUID
    • Profile Added Report
    • Profile Removed Report
    • Profile Enabled Report
    • Profile Disabled Report
    • Profile Specific Data (If defined as allowed by the active Profile)
Broadcast MUID shall not be used as the destination for any MIDI-CI message unless the definition for that
message specifically defines the use of the Broadcast MUID.

4       Establishing a MIDI-CI Connection
To begin using MIDI-CI, a pair of MIDI-CI Devices find each other using a Discovery Transaction.

4.1     The First MIDI-CI Transaction: Discovery
A MIDI-CI Device should find another MIDI-CI Device by acting as an Initiator and sending a Discovery
message (see Section 5.5) with its own MUID as the source. Any MIDI-CI Device that receives the Discovery
Message shall act as a Responder by sending a Reply to Discovery message (see Section 5.6) with its own MUID
as the source and the Initiator's MUID as the destination.

4.2     Subsequent Transactions
Initiator and Responder roles are not fixed. Roles are per Transaction and only persist until that Transaction is
completed.
Following a successful Discovery Transaction between two Devices, either Device may take the role of Initiator
for any subsequent Transactions between the two Devices by sending a MIDI-CI Inquiry to the destination MUID
of a targeted Responder. For any subsequent Transaction, the Responder is a Device that receives a MIDI-CI
Inquiry that was sent to the Responders MUID, acts based on the content of the inquiry sent by an Initiator
Device, and responds to the Initiator with a reply message.

5          MIDI-CI Common Rules and Guidelines
This section outlines concepts and rules common to all categories of MIDI-CI messages and Transactions.

5.1        Categories of MIDI-CI Messages
MIDI-CI defines Universal System Exclusive messages, Transactions, and mechanisms for the inquiry and
negotiation of Device capabilities in four Categories. Each Category contains multiple messages that work
together to deliver a targeted scope of MIDI-CI functionality.
The Category is declared by the value of the highest nibble in the Universal System Exclusive Sub-ID#2 byte.

                                 Table 4 Categories of MIDI-CI Messages
                   Category     Sub-ID#2 Range         Description
                      0         0x00-0x0F              Reserved – No Messages Defined Yet
                        1       0x10-0x1F              Protocol Negotiation (Deprecated)
                        2       0x20-0x2F              Profile Configuration Messages
                        3       0x30-0x3F              Property Exchange Messages
                        4       0x40-0x4F              Process Inquiry Messages
                        5       0x50-0x5F              Reserved – No Messages Defined Yet
                        6       0x60-0x6F              Reserved – No Messages Defined Yet
                        7       0x70-0x7F              Management Messages
    *Note: Sub-ID#2 Range 0x10-0x1F was defined for Protocol Negotiation in previous versions of MIDI-CI [MA03].
    Protocol Negotiation is deprecated as of this version 1.2 of MIDI-CI.

5.2        MIDI-CI Transaction Messages
MIDI-CI Transactions are accomplished using Universal System Exclusive messages.
Message layout tables in this specification show the 0xF0 SysEx Start and 0xF7 SysEx End bytes, which are
required when using the MIDI 1.0 data format. When MIDI-CI messages are carried inside a Universal MIDI
Packet, the F0 and F7 are omitted.
All messages conform to a common format with header and data as follows.

5.2.1 Standard Format for MIDI-CI Messages
All MIDI-CI messages use 0x0D as value for Universal System Exclusive Sub-ID#1.
The Universal System Exclusive Sub-ID#2 determines the Category of message and the function of each message.
                             Table 5 Standard Format for MIDI-CI Messages

    F7       End Universal System Exclusive

  *Note: Multibyte fields are generally LSB First unless defined by MIDI 1.0 as a byte sequence.

Device ID: Source or Destination (depending on type of message)
Values in this Universal System Exclusive Device ID* are used for Channel addressing. Values 0x00-0xF map to
MIDI Channels 1-16. Messages with a Value of 0x7E are addressed to the whole Group, not channelized.
Messages with a Value of 0x7F are addressed to the whole Function Block, not channelized.
Some MIDI-CI messages, such as Property Exchange messages, are only valid when sent to a whole Function
Block 0x7F. See individual messages as defined in this document for whether each message can be used on a per
Group or per channel basis.
In a MIDI-CI inquiry message sent by the Initiator, this is the destination of the inquiry. Default value is 0x7F =
Function Block based inquiry. But the value can be 0x00-0x0F to address a specific MIDI Channel, or 0x7E to
address a specific Group.
In a MIDI-CI reply message sent by the Responder, this is the source of the reply. Default value is 0x7F =
Function Block based reply. But the value can be 0x00-0x0F to reply about a specific MIDI Channel, or 0x7E to
address a specific Group.
Values 0x00-0x0F are for 16 MIDI channels. This allows inquiries and negotiation on a specific channel. This is
useful for using Profile Configuration on a per channel basis. Values 0x00-0x0F and 0x7E shall not be used for
Property Exchange messages.
If a Device sends a message using MIDI-CI Device ID = 0x7F, the message may be sent using any UMP Group
field value which is within the range of the Function Block. When a Receiver receives a message with MIDI-CI
Device ID = 0x7F, it shall send any related replies using the same UMP Group field value.

1 byte MIDI-CI Message Version/Format
In version 1.1 of the MIDI-CI specification, the version number is 0x01. In this version 1.2 of the MIDI-CI
Specification, the version number is 0x02.
The Message Format Version is broken into 2 parts:
    • bits 7..5 – Reserved for future major revisions
    • bits 4..1 – Minor Version number

If any of the reserved bits are set, then that version may have features which are incompatible with the format
of messages in this version.
See Section 5.3 For more information about using the MIDI-CI Version/Format field.

4 bytes Source MUID
The MUID of the Device sending this message.

4 bytes Destination MUID
The MUID of the Device intended to receive this message.

Data
If the message contains any payload, it is in this field. Some messages define multiple fields in the Data field.

5.3       Handling the MIDI-CI Message Version/Format Field
When sending MIDI-CI messages, a Device shall always use its own Message Format Version, which might not
be the same as the Device it is communicating with. Senders should avoid sending messages introduced in a later
Message Format Version than the Receiver supports. If a Device wishes to change to sending a different Message
Format Version, the Device shall invalidate its MUID and initiate a new Discovery Transaction.
When receiving a MIDI-CI message, the Device shall examine the received Message Format Version to determine
response behavior.
      • If the received message is of the same version as the Device, then no special considerations are necessary.
      • If the received version is higher than the Device’s supported version, the Device shall only process the
        fields defined for its supported version and ignores any appended fields, as well as any reserved values and
        bits.
      • If the received version is lower than the Device’s supported version, the Device shall only process the
        fields, values, and bits defined in the received version of MIDI-CI.
      • If any of the reserved bits of the Message Format Version field are set, the Device shall reply with a NAK
        message (error code 0x02, see section 5.11).

5.4       MIDI-CI Versions and Backward Compatibility
In order to ensure compatibility with previous and future MIDI-CI versions, every MIDI-CI implementation shall
follow these rules:
      • Devices shall use Message Format Version 0x01 or higher. Message Format Version 0x00 is deprecated
        and shall not be used.
      • In addition to the given Message Format Version that a Device uses, the device shall be able to receive and
        parse all previous valid versions for all MIDI-CI functions supported by the Device. This rule applies even
        if Inquiries from previous versions have been deprecated in later versions of MIDI-CI.
        Example: A Device that uses Message Format Version 0x03 shall also support reception of versions 0x02
        and 0x01.
      • MIDI-CI Devices are not required to send messages in earlier Message Format Versions.
      • When a Device receives messages of a higher Message Format Version than it implements, it should use the
        Message fields that are known, and ignore any unknown Message fields received.

    • When a Device receives messages of a lower Message Format Version it shall process all relevant Message
      fields received.
    • For sending, devices shall not mix Message Format versions. Devices shall send all messages in the same
      Message Format Version reported in Discovery and Reply to Discovery.
    • If a Device needs to change to a different version of MIDI-CI, it shall invalidate its MUID and initiate a
      new Discovery Transaction with the new version.
    • A Receiver of a Discovery message (or any other message) with the reserved version bits set, reply with a
      NAK message using the Receiver’s Message Format Version and NAK Status Code set to 0x02.
Future MIDI-CI messages in the minor version updates shall only add fields to the end of a message (before F7) –
never alter a field (excluding reserved bytes/bits). Major version updates may structurally change and remove
MIDI-CI messages.
This means that MIDI-CI implementations can handle unsupported minor version updates by ignoring all
unknown extended fields.

5.4.1 Examples of Handling Different Versions of MIDI-CI




                  Figure 4 Two Devices with Different Version/Format of MIDI-CI
Example 1:
Device A sends to Device B
      When Device B receives a MIDI-CI message from Device A, it shall process all the MIDI-CI Header fields
      and Properties 1 through 4. Device B shall ignore Properties 5 and 6.
Example 2:
Device B sends to Device A
      When Device A receives a MIDI-CI message from Device B, it shall process all the MIDI-CI Header fields
      and Properties 1 through 4.
Example 3:
Device A sends an Inquiry message to Device B. Device A knows that Device B only supports v1, but it must still
use the v3 format of the Inquiry message. The additional fields it assembles and sends in the Inquiry will be
ignored by Device B. Device B will reply with the v1 response.
Example 4:
Device B sends an Inquiry message to Device A in format v1. Device A must respond with the v3 format of the
message, well knowing that Device B will ignore all fields that are new in v2 and v3 of that message. Device B
will receive the v3 message, ignoring the additional fields it does not understand.

5.5       Discovery Message
An Initiator shall establish connections to MIDI-CI Responders by sending a Discovery message. The Discovery
message also declares the MUID of the Initiator. A Discovery message may be sent in response to various events
on the Initiator Device. Some examples of when a Discovery message might be sent include:
      • A MIDI-CI capable Device should send a Discovery message after its power on and boot up procedure is
        complete.
      • A MIDI-CI capable Device should send a Discovery message when the user selects the MIDI-CI Start
        button or similar autoconfiguration function on a MIDI Device.
      • A MIDI-CI capable Device should send a Discovery message when the Device or a Function Block in the
        Device has had its previous MUID invalidated and wants to re-establish MIDI-CI connections using a new
        MUID.

3 bytes Device Manufacturer
This is the System Exclusive ID of the Device manufacturer. For System Exclusive ID values that are only 1 byte
in length, the System Exclusive ID value is in the first byte and the remaining 2 bytes are filled with zeroes: ID 00
00

2 bytes Device Family
This identifies the related group of models to which the Device belongs. The manufacturer is free to determine the
grouping of models and the format of the data in this field.

2 bytes Device Family Model Number
This identifies a specific model from the Device Manufacturer. The manufacturer is free to determine the
assignment of values and the format of the data in this field.

4 bytes Software Revision Level
This is the version number of a Device model number. This is typically the version of software or firmware but
may also be the version of hardware. If a model undergoes any version update or other design change that changes
its MIDI implementation or capabilities as may be discovered by MIDI-CI (including Property Exchange), then
this Software Revision Level shall be changed. The manufacturer is free to determine the format of the data in this
field.

5.5.2 Capability Inquiry Category Supported
This field is a bitmap which reports the Categories of MIDI-CI messages the Device supports. A value which is
set high in any bit indicates support for some inquiry messages of that Category. Support for all messages of that
Category is not required to declare support.

The bits correspond to the high nibble of the Sub-ID#2 of various MIDI-CI messages.
See Appendix D: for a list of all MIDI-CI messages in all Categories.
        Note: Management Messages (Sub-ID#2 value=0x70-0x7F) shall be supported by all Devices that
        implement MIDI-CI. This MIDI-CI Discovery message and the associated reply (following) that contain this
        field are both of that Management Message Category.

5.5.3 Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size
All MIDI-CI Devices shall support System Exclusive message lengths of at least 128 bytes. The allowed values in
the Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size are 128 or greater.

MIDI-CI Devices that have the ability to Initiate Transactions for Profile Configuration or Property Exchange
categories shall support message lengths of at least 512 bytes. The allowed values in the Receivable Maximum
SysEx Message Size are 512 or greater.

5.5.4 Output Path Id
Initiators that have multiple MIDI Out connections should use a unique Output Path Id for each connection
(even on the same MUID), to enumerate/differentiate each output. Each MIDI Out connection should use an
unchanging Output Path Id number.
The Initiator might number its MIDI Outputs starting with 0 and sequentially incrementing the value for each
additional MIDI Output. This allows up to 128 unique MIDI Outputs. Initiators with only one MIDI Out
connection or which do not need this feature, should set this to 0.

5.5.5 Timeout for Discovery
After sending a Discovery Message, an Initiator shall wait at least 3 seconds for all Reply to Discovery
Messages to be returned before timing out.

5.6        Reply to Discovery Message
When a MIDI-CI Device receives a Discovery message it shall become a Responder and send this Reply to
Discovery message. This message declares the MUID of the Responder.

*See the Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size in Section 5.5.3.
           Note: This Reply to Discovery message is mandatory for all MIDI-CI Devices. Devices which do not
           support any MIDI-CI Categories may optionally send this reply to inform the Initiator of the existence of a
           device which does not support any MIDI-CI functions.

5.6.1 Output Path Id
The Reply to Discovery shall return the same Output Path Id provided in the originating Discovery Message.

5.6.2 Function Block
The Reply to Discovery shall declare the number of the Function Block that this Responder represents. This
allows an Initiator to tie a Function Block to a MIDI-CI Device. This allows the Initiator to know the UMP
Groups associated with this MIDI-CI Device. If the MIDI-CI Device is not associated with a Function Block (for
example, is connected by a MIDI 1.0 byte stream), then set the value to 0x7F (no Function Block). See Section 3.1
for more information about Function Blocks.

5.7        Inquiry: Endpoint Message
An Initiator may send the Inquiry: Endpoint Message to a Function Block in a Responder to get information about
the UMP Endpoint which has the Function Block. A Status field selects the target data.

              0x01-0x7F       Reserved

In this version of MIDI-CI, the only defined Status value is 0x00 which is used to get the Product Instance Id of
the UMP Endpoint which has the Function Block addressed by the inquiry. This inquiry gets the Product Instance
Id which is also declared in a Product Instance Id Notification message (See the M2-104-UM Universal MIDI
Packet (UMP) Format and MIDI 2.0 Protocol, Version 1.1 [MA06]).

5.8        Reply to Endpoint Message
When a MIDI-CI Device receives an Inquiry: Endpoint Information message, it should reply with the Reply
to Endpoint Information message. If the Device is not able to provide the requested information of the given
Status, it should reply with a MIDI-CI NAK message (See Section 5.11).

5.8.3.1 Information Data for Status Value 0x00: Endpoint Product Instance Id
When sending the Reply to Endpoint Information with Status 0x00, the Information Data field contains the
Endpoint Product Instance Id. The value shall match the Product Instance Id which is declared in a Product
Instance Id Notification message (See the M2-104-UM Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format and MIDI 2.0
Protocol, Version 1.1, [MA06]).
Product Instance Id should be, where possible, the same as the Serial Number of the Device and should be a
unique number per Manufacturer/Family/Model. The Product Instance Id should be persistent across power
cycles.
Product Instance Id shall be ASCII Text in the ordinal range 32-126.
The Product Instance Id shall not be any longer than 16 bytes in size,
The Product Instance Id can be used to:
      • Re-identify a Device after power cycling
      • Re-identify a Device after a MUID invalidation
      • Identify the same Device if using multiple Function Blocks each with its own MUID
      • Distinguish multiple Devices of the same model
      • Facilitating MUID collision handling

5.9       Invalidate MUID Message
An Invalidate MUID message is used as defined in Section 3.3.2.
Every MIDI-CI Device shall process received Invalidate MUID messages.
If a Device receives an Invalidate MUID message with the Target MUID set to the same value as its own MUID,
it shall terminate any active Transactions and generate a new MUID.
If a Device receives an Invalidate MUID message with the Target MUID set to the same value as any other
Devices it has previously discovered, it shall terminate any active Transactions with that MUID and should
discard all cached information of Devices with the invalidated MUID.

outstanding Transactions that are using the Target MUID, including Property Exchange inquiries, replies, and
Subscriptions.
When a Device receives an Invalidate MUID message, it does not send any reply or confirmation message. To re-
establish MIDI-CI connections using a new MUID, the Device which has had its MUID invalidated should send a
new MIDI-CI Discovery Message to all connections.

5.9.1 Resolving Collisions of MUID - Responder
If a Responder receives a MIDI-CI Discovery message with the Source MUID set to the same value as its own
MUID, then the Responder shall select one of two options to resolve the collision:
Option A, only applicable if the Responder has not yet used its MUID in any prior Transactions:
    1. The Responder shall change its own MUID to a new value.
    2. The Responder shall send a Reply to Discovery message with the new MUID value.
Option B:
    1. The Responder shall reply with an Invalidate MUID message with the Target MUID set to the duplicated
        MUID.
    2. The Responder shall change its own MUID to a new value.
    3. The Initiator shall change its own MUID to a new value.
    4. Any Device or all Devices may Initiate a new Discovery Transaction

5.9.2 Resolving Collisions of MUID - Initiator
If an Initiator sends a MIDI-CI Discovery message and receives multiple replies and where two or more of the
Responders have the same MUID as each other, then:
    1. The Initiator shall send an Invalidate MUID message with the Target MUID set to the duplicated MUID.
    2. All Devices with the duplicated MUID shall change their MUID to a new value.
    3. Any Device or all Devices may Initiate a new Discovery Transaction

5.10    MIDI-CI ACK Message
The MIDI-CI ACK Message is a message for dealing with positive acknowledgement of an action, or to provide a
notice of ongoing activity, such as timeout wait messages.

5.10.1 Original Transaction Sub-ID#2 Classification
A MIDI-CI ACK message declares the result of a successful transaction or declares the status of an in-progress
MIDI-CI transaction. The Original Transaction Sub-Id#2 Classification is used, along with other fields, to link the
ACK message with the original Transaction.

5.10.2 ACK Status codes and ACK Status Data
The ACK Status code provides more information as to the cause of the issue. Some Status Codes require
additional information in the Status Data field to help process the ACK. Future documents will describe other
ACK Status Codes and what they declare. If no additional information is needed, set the value to 0x00.

5.10.3 ACK details for each Sub Id Classification
Each branch of MIDI-CI requires unique information that relates to the branch. The 5 bytes are used to describe
details about the MIDI-CI Branch used:
• Profile Configuration - the 5 bytes used here represent the Profile Id
• Property Exchange - Byte 1 is the PE Stream Id. Byte 2 and 3 represent the current Chunk number (LSB first).
  Other bytes are reserved.
• Process Inquiry - The 5 Bytes are reserved.

5.10.4 Message Length (ml) and Message Text Encoding
Messages provide extended human readable text that further explains the reason for the MIDI-CI ACK message.
These messages should be presented to the user.
ACK messages shall not exceed the responder’s Maximum Receivable SysEx Size as established by MIDI-CI
Discovery. Therefore, it is generally safe to send up to 103 bytes of Message text.
7-Bit Encoding of Message Text
Due to the restrictions of MIDI 1.0 SysEx, Message values have the following rules:
    1. 7-bit ASCII characters are supported, except that the "\" character has a special function as defined in the
         JSON standard, ECMA404 [EXT01].
        For clarity in MIDI-CI, as ECMA404 may be unclear about this, the forward slash character "/" can be
        optionally escaped so it can be encoded in Message values as either "/" or "\/".
    2. All characters which are not 7-bit ASCII characters shall be converted to UTF-16, and then escaped using
        "\u" as defined in the JSON standard, ECMA404 [EXT01].
               Note: These are pure ASCII characters. Therefore, the UTF-8 rules defined in the UMP and MIDI
               2.0 Protocol specification [MA06] do not apply.
    3. The Message should not use ASCII Characters below 0x20 (space), except for 0x0A (line feed). Other
        ASCII Characters below 0x20 such as 0x08 (tab) and 0x0D (carriage return) should be ignored.
Unicode Characters Examples:
    1. Accepted Beat ♪ is converted to Accepted Beat \u266a.
    2. 残りわずか5バイト is converted to \u6B8B\u308A\u308F\u305A\u304B5\u30D0\u30A4\u30C8

5.11    The MIDI-CI NAK Message
The MIDI-CI NAK message is used to respond to any message that a Device does not understand. Examples of
application for this NAK message include:
    • Reply to a MIDI-CI message the Device does not support
    • Reply to a MIDI-CI message with MIDI-CI message Version/Format the Device does not support
    • Reply to a malformed MIDI-CI message
    • Reply to a Profile Enable or Disable message for a Profile the Responder does not support or does not
      support on the requested channel.
    • Reply to a MIDI-CI message with a MIDI-CI Message Format Version with reserved bits set.

5.11.1 Original Transaction Sub-ID#2 Classification
A MIDI-CI NAK message is always the result of a failed MIDI-CI transaction. The Original Transaction Sub-Id#2
Classification is used, along with other fields, to link the NAK message with the original Transaction.

5.11.2 NAK Status codes and NAK Status Data
The NAK Status code provides more information as to the cause of the issue. Some Status Codes require
additional information in the Status Data field to help process the NAK. If no additional information is needed, set
the value to 0x00.

6       Protocol Negotiation
Version 1.1 of MIDI-CI included mechanisms for two Devices to negotiate which Protocol to use for
communication. Those mechanisms are deprecated beginning with version 1.2 of MIDI-CI. They have been
replaced by UMP Endpoint mechanisms defined in the M2-104-UM Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) Format and
MIDI 2.0 Protocol, Version 1.1 specification [MA06].
For definitions of Protocol Negotiation mechanisms and the deprecated messages, see MIDI-CI version 1.1

7          Profile Configuration
Profiles define specific implementations of a set of MIDI messages chosen to suit a particular instrument, Device
type, or to accomplish a particular task. Two Devices that conform to the same Profile will generally have greater
interoperability between them than Devices using MIDI without Profiles. Profiles increase interoperability and
ease of use while reducing the amount of manual configuration of Devices by users.
The MIDI-CI specification contains only the base message definitions used for Profile Configuration. Critical
information and further rules for implementing Profile Configuration are defined in the M2-102-U Common Rules
for MIDI-CI Profiles specification [MA04].
Detailed information and further implementation rules for individual Profiles are defined in specifications for each
Profile.
All Devices which implement a Profile shall comply with the rules of this Section 7 Profile Configuration, the
rules of theM2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles [MA04] specification, and the rules of the
specification for the Profile.

7.1        Profile Configuration Mechanism
Profiles are controlled by the following Common Profile Configuration messages:
      • Profile Inquiry
      • Reply to Profile Inquiry
      • Profile Added Report
      • Profile Removed Report
      • Inquiry: Profile Details Message
      • Reply to Profile Details Message
      • Set Profile On
      • Set Profile Off
      • Profile Enabled Report
      • Profile Disabled Report
These messages are defined in this specification but details of implementing the messages are further defined in
the Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles specification [MA04].
More information about individual Profiles is defined in other specifications of MA and AMEI.

7.2        Profile Inquiry Message
An Initiator may send this to request a list of Profiles that a connected Responder Device supports.

7.3.1 Profile ID
Each Profile has a 5-byte identifier. Standard Defined Profiles are those adopted by AMEI and MA. The value of
the Profile ID Byte 1 is 0x7E (Universal). Bytes 2-4 for each Profile uses the ID values defined by the Profile
Specification and by other AMEI/MA Profile related specifications.
Manufacturers may use MIDI-CI to control Manufacturer specific Profiles of their own proprietary design by
using their own System Exclusive ID. For System Exclusive ID values that are only 1 byte in length, the System
Exclusive ID value is in the first byte and the remaining two bytes are filled with zeroes.
Each Manufacturer SysEx ID can freely use the two bytes of Manufacturer Specific Info. These two bytes allow
up to 16384 different Manufacturer Profile numbers.

7.3.2 Currently Enabled
These are Profiles that the Device supports and that are currently active at the time of inquiry. Some Devices
might have a Profile that is already active (Enabled) before receiving a Set Profile On message. For example, a
MIDI acoustic piano might be fixed to conform to a Piano Profile Specification; Piano Profile is always Enabled.

7.3.3 Currently Disabled
These are Profiles that a Device can support but that are not currently active. When a Profile on a Device is not
active (Disabled), the Device does not currently conform to the requirements of the Profile specification. But the
Device can be switched to conform to the requirements of the Profile specification using the Set Profile On
message.

The Profile Removed Report message shall have the Destination MUID set to Broadcast (0x7F 7F 7F 7F).
If the Device is removing a Profile which is currently enabled, then the Device shall send a Profile Disabled
Report message for that Profile before sending the Profile Removed Report message.

7.6         Profile Details Inquiry Message
The Profile Details Inquiry message is used by an Initiator to discover details of the Profile implementation of a
Responder. For example, an Initiator might discover:
      1. How many Channels may be used or assigned by the Responder for a multi-channel Profile.
      2. Which optional Profile features the Responder is capable of supporting.
The details which may be discovered are defined by the specification for the requested Profile Id.
These details may be discovered before a Profile is enabled. For example, in some cases, it may be necessary to
know the number of MIDI Channels available for use by a Profile before enabling that Profile. This message may
also be used to discover details about a Responder's Profile implementation while it is enabled.
For more details see the M2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Profiles [MA04] specification.

8         Property Exchange
Property Exchange is used to Inquire, Get, and Set many properties including but not limited to Device
configuration settings, a list of controllers and resolution, a list of patches with names and other metadata,
manufacturer, model number, and version.
The MIDI-CI specification contains only the base message definitions used for Property Exchange. Critical
information and further rules for implementing Property Exchange are defined in the [MA05] M2-102-U Common
Rules for Property Exchange specification.
Detailed information about the Header Data and Property for individual PE Resources, including all defined
properties and semantics, is defined in specifications for each PE Resource.
All Devices which implement a PE Resource shall comply with the rules of this Section 8 Property Exchange, the
rules of [MA05] M2-102-U Common Rules for MIDI-CI Property Exchange specification, and the rules of the
specification for the PE Resource.

8.1       Property Exchange Inquiry and Negotiation Mechanism
Properties are exchanged by the following Common Property Exchange messages:
      • Inquiry: Property Exchange Capabilities
      • Reply to Property Exchange Capabilities
      • Inquiry: Get Property Data
      • Reply to Get Property Data
      • Inquiry: Set Property Data
      • Reply to Set Property Data
      • Subscription
      • Reply to Subscription
      • Notify

8.2       Property Exchange Addressing
The Device ID field of all Property Exchange messages shall be set to 0x0F (whole Function Block). Property
Exchange mechanisms intended for individual Channels within a Function Block may be addressed by
channelized properties within the Property Data.

8.3       Property Data May Be Sent in Multiple Chunks
A Device may choose to send a Property Exchange message as a single SysEx message or as a set of multiple
SysEx messages or “Chunks”.
When a complete Property Exchange message, with all defined SysEx fields and the payload Property Data,
exceeds the size of the “Receivable Maximum SysEx Message Size” of the other Device (discovered in the initial
Discovery Transaction between the Devices) the sender shall break the message into multiple Chunks. A Device
may also choose to send a message in multiple Chunks for its own design requirements.
If the Device chooses to send Property Data in multiple Chunks, it shall specify the “Number of Chunks in
Message” and shall label each Chunk with a sequential “Number of This Chunk”. The Number of This Chunk
shall always start counting from a value of 0x0001.
There is always at least one Chunk, even if it does not contain any Property Data. If there is no Property Data,
then the Number of Chunks and Number of This Chunk shall both be set to a value of 0x0001 (See Section 8.3.2).
If the sender Device does not know the total number of Chunks in advance, the Device shall set the Number of
Chunks in Message to 0x0000. Then when sending Chunks, the sender shall set the Number of This Chunk for
each Chunk in a sequential count as usual (starting the count from a value of 0x0001).

When Number of Chunks in Message is unknown, the final Chunk shall declare a new value for Number of
Chunks in Message to match the sequential count value of Number of This Chunk.
If a sender runs out of Property Data or otherwise needs to terminate a message before sending the expected
number of Chunks to match Number of Chunks in Message, then the final Chunk sent shall indicate the end of
data in one of two ways.
    1. If the sender knows that all the Property Data sent is complete or usable, then the sender shall change the

    2. If the sender does not know if all the Property Data sent is complete or usable, then the Number of This
         Chunk for the final Chunk shall be set to 0x0000.
If the sender runs out of Property Data before sending a final Chunk with data, then the sender shall send one
more Chunk with no Property Data to complete the data set as defined above.

8.3.1 Header Data in First Chunk Only
Header Data shall always be in the first Chunk only. Chunk numbers 2 and higher shall set the Length of
Following Header Data to 0x0000 and shall not contain any Header Data.

8.3.2 No Chunking of Header Data
Any message that contains Header Data only and does not contain any Property Data shall not use the Chunking
mechanism. For any message that does not contain any Property Data, Number of Chunks in Message shall be set
to 0x0001 and Number of This Chunk shall be set to 0x0001.

8.4        Multiple Simultaneous Inquiries and Request ID
A Request ID allows the Device to support multiple messages or PE Transactions being sent and received at one
time. This is useful to prevent a larger PE message which is split over many chunks from blocking smaller
requests. Each Device may support one or more Request IDs, with the default being one Request ID. Every Chunk
of a message shall contain the same Request ID. The reply to an inquiry message shall contain the same Request
ID as was sent in the associated inquiry message.
The Initiator may freely choose the value of the Request ID in the initial request message, but the value shall be
unique among all Request IDs from this Initiator to the specific Responder.
Request ID values are unique only to the connection between a specific Initiator and specific Responder,
determined by the MUID of those two Devices. The same Request ID value may be active on a separate MIDI
connection between a different pair of MUIDs without incurring a collision.

8.5        Inquiry: Property Exchange Capabilities
An Initiator shall send this to exchange basic information with the Responder before sending and receiving
subsequent Property Exchange messages.
This inquiry does not need to be performed for every Property Exchange Transaction. Devices may cache
information discovered by this message so that this inquiry might be performed only once after the Discovery
Transaction and before starting any other Property Exchange inquiries.

9.4         MIDI Message Report
The MIDI Message Report feature allows Initiators to request information from a Responder about the current
state or values of those Responder's parameters which are currently controllable by MIDI Messages. This
mechanism cannot be used to target any messages which are not stateful.
Use cases are (but not limited to):
      • Query the current values of parameters which are settable by MIDI Controller messages.
      • Query to find out which Program is currently active.
      • Query to find out which Notes are currently actively playing.
      • Query to find out the current song position of a sequence.
      • Evaluate behavior of a device during MIDI compliance tests.
The MIDI Message Report Transaction proceeds with 4 stages:
      1. An Initiator requests a MIDI Message Report using an Inquiry: MIDI Message Report request. Certain
          fields in the message declare target parameters based on the type of MIDI message which control those
          targets.
      2. The Responder's reply consists of multiple messages, starting with the Reply to MIDI Message Report
          (Begin) message. This message contains bitmaps indicating which of the requested messages the device
          supports and is about to return in reply to the MIDI Message Report request.
      3. The Responder reports the current state or value of all requested and supported MIDI parameters by
          sending the associated MIDI Messages with the current parameter values.
      4. The Responder declares the end of the MIDI Message Report by sending an End of MIDI Message Report
          message.

Note that stage 3 above of this mechanism uses MIDI Messages in an atypical manner. In other common
applications, MIDI Messages are usually sent as commands to set parameters in another receiving Device. But in
this application, MIDI Messages sent in reply by a Responder are not intended to be commands to the Initiator,
but instead are a report of the current values in the Responder. The Initiator may also and optionally use those
messages as commands if the Initiator needs them for a specific application (such as synchronizing the value(s)
between Initiator and Responder).

9.5        Inquiry: MIDI Message Report
An Initiator sends an Inquiry: MIDI Message Report message to request a MIDI data report from a Responder.
Bitmaps in the message allow the Initiator to specify which message states are being requested:
• System Messages
• Channel Controller Messages
• Note Data Messages
A Device may choose not to reply to all message requests in a MIDI Message Report, even if the Device
implements the requested message. As an example, a sound generator which supports MIDI notes and per-note
controllers is not required to report its internal note and per-note controller states.

An inquiry requesting a set of active Notes should only be used for compliance purposes.
In case of Channel Controller and Note Data Message types, an Initiator may specify a MIDI Channel in the
Device ID field. An inquiry requesting System Messages shall have the Device ID set to 0x7F (Function Block). If
Device ID is 0x7F when Channel Controller and/or Note Data Message types are requested, the Responder shall
report all supported Groups and Channels.
The Responder shall return a MIDI-CI NAK Message if Device ID is set between 00-0F (channel 1-16) and that
MIDI Channel is not in use on the Function Block (or if no Function Blocks exist, then if that MIDI Channel is
not in use on the Device).

9.5.1 Message Data Control
An Initiator sets the Message Data Control field to configure the amount of data the Responder will return in
response to a MIDI Message Report request.

                                 Table 44 Message Data Control Values
    Value        Description
     0x00        Do not report any data, send Begin / End replies only. This enables the Initiator to query
                 which types of MIDI messages the Responder is capable of reporting by a MIDI Message
                 Report

     0x01        Report only controllers with non-default values, active notes, and per-note controllers with
                 non-default values.

 0x02 - 0x7E     Reserved

     0x7F        Full report of all requested and supported controllers, notes, and supported per-note
                 controllers

Setting the Message Data Control value to 0x00 is useful for Initiators to detect Responders MIDI Message Report
capabilities. This can especially be useful in automated MIDI compliance tests.
Setting the Message Data Control value to 0x01 is intended to reduce the amount of data being sent by the
Responder. Many Controllers, especially Per-Note-Controllers, are typically set to their default values (e.g., 100
for Volume, 64 for Pan and Balance, 0 for most other controllers), such controllers can be omitted from the report.
For a list of standardized default values see M2-113-UM MIDI-CI Profile: Default Control Change Mapping
specification [MA07].
Setting the Message Data Control value to 0x7F requests a full report of all supported and requested messages. If a
full report of note data is requested, a Responder should report Note On / Off messages for all active and inactive
notes.

9.6        Reply to MIDI Message Report
If a Responder which supports Process Inquiry receives an Inquiry: MIDI Message Report, then Responder shall
start its reply by sending a Reply to MIDI Message Report message.
The Reply to MIDI Message Report message has fields which contain the same MIDI Message bitmaps as the
Inquiry: MIDI Message Report message. The Responder shall set values in the bitmaps to declare which of the
types of messages it will be sending in its response.
For example: An Initiator may request Channel Pressure. However, the Responder cannot provide this so will set
this bit to 0 to indicate that it will not be sending Channel Pressure data.
The Responder shall not set any additional bits and shall not report messages that were not requested.
The Responder shall set the Device ID field to the same value as in the Inquiry: MIDI Message Report message it
received. If Device ID is 0x7E (Group) or 0x7F (Function Block), the Responder shall not send individual Reply
to MIDI Message Report (Begin) and End Messages for each individual supported channel.

9.7        MIDI Message Reporting
After the Responder declares the supported MIDI message(s) in Reply to MIDI Message Report (see Section 9.6)
the Responder shall send the MIDI message(s) it has declared with the current value for each of the supported
message(s).

9.7.1 Order of Message Reporting
Messages should be sent according to the following:
      1. Messages should be sent in the order of messages declared in the Bitmap of requested System Messages
          D0-D7, Bitmap of requested Channel Controller Messages D0-D7, and Bitmap of requested Note Data
          Messages D0-D7 fields of the Inquiry: Reply to MIDI Message Report.
          For example, if Notes, Poly Pressure, and Per-Note Controllers are requested, then the state of Note
          On/Off for all notes will be reported first, followed by the state of Poly Pressure for all notes, and then
          followed by the state of Per-Note Controllers for all notes.
      2. If the Device ID is set to 0x7E, all the channelized messages on a Channel should be sent before sending
           messages on the next Channel. Channelized messages should be sent in ascending Channel number order
           in the Group from Channel 1 through 16.
      3. If the Device ID is set to 0x7F, messages should be sent for each Group according to the order defined in 1.
           and 2. above before sending messages on the next Group. Messages should be sent in ascending Group
           number for the Groups in the Function Block.

9.7.2 Reporting Rules for Specific Messages
The following messages have unique rules for reporting that type.

MTC Quarter Frame
The Responder shall send the complete set of eight quarter frame messages required to fully declare the current
time.

Control Change
For each Control Change message recognized:
      1. Control Change Index 0-63:
        A. If implemented as MSB+LSB then the Responder shall send Control Change 0-31 each followed by the
            matching LSB 32-63(0+32, 1+33, … etc.) with the current value of the Control Change.
        B. If 32-63 are not used as LSB for 0-32, then the Responder shall send Control Change 0-63 in index order
             with the current value of the Control Change.
      2. Control Change 64-119,122: The Responder shall send the Control Change with the current value of the
          Control Change.
      3. The Responder shall send only the Mode Messages for the current Mode (124, 125, 126 or 127) enabled.
          The Responder shall indicate the correct number of channels in Mono Mode On.

      4. If in MIDI 1.0 Protocol: The Responder shall only send Control Change 0, 6. 32. 38 and 98–101 if these are
           (incorrectly) used as individual Controller Messages. These shall not be sent as part of Control Change
           reporting if they are in use as Bank Select, RPN and NRPN messages.

Registered Controller / RPN
MIDI 1 Protocol only: After all RPN's have been sent, the Responder shall send the Null Function Value RPN

Assignable Controller / NRPN
MIDI 1 Protocol only: After all NRPN's have been sent, the Responder shall send the Null Function Value NRPN

Program Change
In MIDI 1.0 Protocol:
If Bank Select is supported, the Responder shall send Bank Select MSB and LSB followed by a Program Change
message.
If Bank Select is not supported, the Responder shall send only a Program Change.
In MIDI 2.0 Protocol the Responder shall send a Program Change message with Bank Select fields set properly.

Note On and Note Off
1a. In MIDI 1.0 Protocol: The Responder shall send a Note On message for each currently active note with the
original velocity value.
1b. In MIDI 2.0 Protocol: The Responder shall send Note On messages for each currently active note with the
original values of Attribute Type, Velocity, and Attribute Data field.
2. For every Note On message which has been sent, the Responder shall send a matching Note Off message prior
to sending the End of MIDI Message Report.

9.8        End of MIDI Message Report
After all requested messages have been reported, the Responder shall complete the reply by sending an End of
MIDI Message Report message.

9.8.1 Incomplete MIDI Message Report
If a Responder needs to abort a MIDI Message Report or has an error, the Responder shall send a MIDI-CI NAK
with Status Code 0x20 (Terminate Inquiry) or 0x40 (Error occurred, please retry) See Section 5.11. If an Initiator
receives a NAK, the Initiator shall assume that the MIDI Message Report Transaction has ended, even if an End
of MIDI Message Report has not been received.

9.8.2 Potential Issues with Ordering
An incorrect MIDI implementation might change the ordering of System Exclusive messages and Channel Voice
Messages in a MIDI Message stream. This could create problems when bracketing MIDI Message Reports
(comprised of Channel Voice Messages) with the messages described here (System Exclusive Messages). Devices
shall process all MIDI messages in the order received to avoid such problems.

Appendix A: Avoiding Collisions of MUID
MIDI-CI relies on every Device on a MIDI connection having its own, unique MUID. If a collision of MUID
occurs, where more than one Device on a MIDI connection selects the same MUID, MIDI-CI provides rules and
mechanisms for resolving the collision (see Sections 5.9.1 and 5.9.2). But it is better if collision is avoided in the
first place. Following are some suggestions for avoiding collisions of MUID. None of the suggestions in this
appendix are requirements for conformance.

A.1 Device Design
The chance of a collision of MUID is greatly reduced if all MIDI-CI Devices use good random number generators
for their MUIDs.
There are multiple methods to generate a good random number. Some possible designs may include some of the
following mechanisms:
    • In any Device with a real time clock or high-resolution timer, use current time as input seed to the Random
      Number Generator. Do not use such a time when powering up, but of the (first) use of a MUID, or another
      irregular event, to avoid MUID collisions when similar Devices are powered up at the same time.
    • Use the low bits of a high frequency timer (megahertz range), e.g., CPU clock cycles.
    • Devices with a unique serial number might include it in the RNG seed.
    • Events and incoming numbers from outside can be used for a RNG seed, too. E.g., data in incoming non-
      MIDI data (e.g., UDP/TCP source port numbers, hash, or CRC on a series of data coming in on different
      interfaces), time of arrival of incoming data.
    • USB and/or network topology can be used to seed the RNG.
    • Desktop PC Operating Systems generate good Random Numbers. Software should use system supplied
      numbers.
    • Many MCUs have built in random number generators.
    • Use onboard circuitry to generate noise for use as an input seed.
    • Note that simulation of Random Number Generators that use floating pins or clocks/oscillators with logic
      gates will not likely generate a random number.

A.1.1 Using Product Instance Id
If a Device receives a MIDI-CI Discovery message with a MUID that matches its own MUID and Device
identifiers, it can use the Product Instance ID to differentiate between 2 scenarios:
    1. An echo back of its own message (matching Product Instance Id
    2. A MUID collision with another Device of the same model (different Product Instance Id)

A.1.2 Manufacturer Suggestions to Users
Device manufacturers can help users to avoid the chances of a MUID collision with system configuration advice
including the following:
    • Connect one Device to one Device. Do not use MIDI Thru. Do not use MIDI merger (especially for low
      power Devices).
    • Connect directly by USB to a Host to get unique addressing for one Device on one Port.
    • If you need to merge MIDI streams, use an intelligent Central Hub or Connection Manager that acts as a
      Device MUID proxy, translating MUID in all messages to/from the colliding Devices.

Appendix B: Version Considerations for MIDI-CI Specification
Updates
B.1 Increasing the Message Format Version
The MIDI-CI Message Minor Format Version number shall be increased whenever a MIDI-CI specification
update does one or more of the following:
    • add new messages in existing categories unless the existence of the new messages can be discovered, and
      the new message does not change the function of other messages in the category.
    • extend existing messages.
    • deprecate messages.
The MIDI-CI Message Minor Format Version number should be increased whenever a MIDI-CI specification
update does one or more of the following if AMEI/MA feels the impact is sufficiently significant:
    • define previously reserved fields, bits in a bitmap, or values.
The MIDI-CI Message Minor Format Version number may be increased whenever a MIDI-CI specification update
does one or more of the following if the working group feels the impact is sufficiently significant:
    • introduce a new MIDI-CI message category.
The MIDI-CI Message Format Version number may stay the same if an update only introduces editorial changes.
A new MIDI-CI Message Major Version shall be introduced whenever a MIDI-CI specification update does one
or more of the following which are likely to be incompatible with prior versions:
    • change mechanisms of previously defined messages.
    • change definitions of previously defined message fields.
    • change data format of previously defined message fields.
    • insert new fields between previously defined message fields.
    • deprecate or remove messages.
The goal is that for every given Message Format Version, the fields and the total length of every message are well
defined. This facilitates compliance testing, and it will prevent implementations which add accidental or private
data to MIDI-CI messages.
Increasing the MIDI-CI message version applies to all messages, regardless of whether they were changed or not.
In general, the MIDI-CI specification document version is independent from the Message Format Version.

B.2 Adding New Messages or Categories
The definition of every new message shall mention the initial MIDI-CI Message Format Version when this
message was introduced. This also applies to all messages that are added with a new MIDI-CI category. The
specification text of an added category shall also specify the initial message version.

B.3 Modifying Existing Messages
Modifying existing messages should only add fields. Existing fields should not be modified.
When a specification update extends an existing message, the specification shall clearly specify which fields were
added in this MIDI-CI message version as has been done for some messages in this version of specification.

B.4 Removing and Deprecating Messages
When a message is removed or deprecated, the specification shall either include the definition of the message, as
defined in the last revision before the message was removed or deprecated, or declare which prior version of the

Appendix C: MIDI Chaining Limitation
It is strongly recommended not to use MIDI Thru ports or a MIDI merger when using MIDI-CI.
Behavior is undefined.


MIDI-CI Negotiations will work reliably on a bidirectional link between two Devices that both support MIDI-CI.
MIDI-CI does not support all topologies that MIDI 1.0 allows. MIDI Thru ports add a complication that might
cause errors. A MIDI merger Device might also introduce errors.

CI Devices may provide an intelligent MIDI Thru function or an intelligent MIDI merge function that performs
any conversions necessary to support such topologies and help mitigate potential incompatibility issues for the
user. The details of such a design are not defined in this version of MIDI-CI.

Appendix E: Minimum Requirements
To support MIDI-CI at the very minimum, every MIDI-CI Device shall do all of the following.


    1. MIDI-CI Devices shall meet all these general requirements:
           • Support System Exclusive message lengths of at least 128 bytes. Support System Exclusive message
             lengths of at least 512 bytes if either Profile Configuration or Property Exchange is supported.
           • Respond to MIDI-CI Discovery messages
           • Respond to Invalidate MUID Messages
           • Be able to send a NAK message when appropriate


    2. MIDI-CI Devices shall implement multiple features, as defined in the MIDI-CI specification, to properly
       and fully meet the general requirements listed in 1) above.
          For example: To properly respond to MIDI-CI Discovery message, a MIDI-CI Device must generate its
          own random MUID, detect any conflict between the MUID of another Device with its own MUID and
          take steps to resolve the collision (not the only requirements). To Respond to Invalidate MUID
          Message, a MIDI-CI Device must be able to generate a new, different MUID (not the only
          requirement).


Even devices that do not implement any Category of MIDI-CI negotiations (Profile Configuration, Property
Exchange, or Process Inquiry) are encouraged to use MIDI-CI. The central feature of the minimum requirements
above is the ability to Respond to a MIDI-CI Discovery messages. A MIDI-CI Discovery Transaction informs the
MIDI system that a device exists on a connection and provides fundamental, identifying data which is very useful
for system configuration.
